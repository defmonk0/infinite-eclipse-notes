### Conversations & Calculations

* *Armadyl*, alone in his room, casts Sending to *Niefendil*:
  * "I don't want us to kill each other. You can talk to me." - *Armadyl*
  * "Death is but only one means of extracting the information I need from you. To avoid it via talk relies on what you may share." - *Niefendil*
* *Sennin* once again approaches *Ergan Ilukar* and casts Contact Other Plane, attempting to connect with *Ergan Ilukar*'s patron.
  * The spell fails, and *Sennin* manages to gather that was because the being in question is *not* on another plane.
  * As he pulls away, *Sennin* swears he hears a chuckle.
* *Sennin* then goes to search out *Mytejager* and inform him of what he learned from his spell.
  * Figured he shouldn't be the only person to know, and is worried that the patron has more specific goals for *Ergan Ilukar*.
  * *Mytejager* agrees that they should continue to learn more about this patron and what it wants.
* *Mytejager* leaves to go shopping.
  * Eventually finds a blacksmith (*The Ironsmith*) near the docks, but they specifically deal in anchors and ship repairs.
  * This gives *Mytejager* an idea, and he works with the blacksmith, *Erid Loderr*, to modify a smaller anchor into a returnable ranged weapon.
  * After paying for the creation, *Mytejager* states that if it works well, he'd be back to commission a refined version at some point.
  * *Mytejager*'s personable charm drops *Erid Loderr*'s defenses, and she leads him into a hidden cellar in the back store room.
    * This room contains racks of weapons and armor, which she explains she sells without a license to sailors from *Calafore* who pass through.
    * *Mytejager* directs her to speak with *Albar Ronaro*, stating they may be looking for new equipment on the down-low.
  * Wrapping up, *Mytejager* buys all the javelins that *Erid Loderr* has available and gets the name of another blacksmith across town, *Reega*, who might have more if he needs them.
  * Returning to the guest house, *Mytejager* begins practicing with his new 'weapon' in the backyard.
* *Armadyl* casts Sending to contact *Ribble Silverthread*, and check in on him.
  * He learns *Ribble Silverthread* is currently traveling with an expedition, and resting at the *Dam of Birkozik*
* While *Mytejager* is out, *Alenia Eldaloth* sits down with *Armadyl* to have a conversation about recent events.
  * *Armadyl* thought killing *Artlaag* would be the one to cause him the least grief, but found no catharsis in it.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* is confused, wondering if they simply made things worse by attacking *Artlaag* and forcing him to take the worms.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* questions the decision morally, and *Armadyl* justifies it at least tactically (though he questions goading them afterwards).
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* states that she wishes to steal the Sending Stone so *Mytejager* can't taunt them anymore, and agree to recruit *Rivian*'s assistance to do so.
  * Eventually, the conversation turns to whether some people deserve death.
    * *Alenia Eldaloth* comes to the conclusion that it's bad as a punitive measure but not unreasonable as a preventative one, and that anyone is capable of redemption if they truly want it.
    * *Armadyl* languishes that he doesn't like killing people and that there has to be a better solution, but can't figure one out in the short timetable that they have.
  * *Armadyl* goes on to share his final Sending with *Niefendil*, and the other things he's learned so far.
    * He mentions that he found *Niefendil*'s closeness to *Uklu* of note.
    * He also posits that the orphans in *Manfred Iranapha*'s story were them.
    * Finally, he knows *Mharu* directed *Niefendil* to have *Uklu* harm the animal from the story.

### Pre-Dawn Ploy

* *Alenia Eldaloth* goes to find *Rivian* and *Beaks* messing with *Ergan Ilukar*, and the two discuss and agree on a plan to take the Sending Stone.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* agrees to come to his defense if he is found out, and that they will proceed with the plan tonight during a watch.
* Eventually, on the final watch, *Alenia Eldaloth* and *Rivian* put their plan into action.
  * *Beaks* keeps watch while the two of them work on retrieving the stone.
  * Between *Rivian*'s invisibility and *Alenia Eldaloth*'s use of Pass Without A Trace, the two are easily able to take the Bag Of Holding from *Mytejager*.
  * Bag in hand, *Rivian* then plants drugs, alcohol, and the bag on *Ergan Ilukar* as a mixed prank and diversion before slipping outside to finish their watch.
* As morning comes and *the party* awakens, *Ergan Ilukar* finds himself among the mess as *Mytejager* follows the path of drugs in search of the Bag Of Holding.
  * Finding the scene, *Mytejager* calls for *Alenia Eldaloth* and the others to join them.
  * *Ergan Ilukar* goes on to explain that, while it looks bad, he did manage to speak to his patron and quickly redirects the path of conversation.
  * *Ergan Ilukar* informs them that he was unable to get the patron's name, but that they were not a god and had no issues with *Birkoziik* or *Ergan Ilukar*'s relationship with him.
  * *Sennin* then shares his revelation from the earlier casting of Contact Other Plane with the rest of *the party*.
* Frustrated at the situation, *Alenia Eldaloth* storms off to the kitchen to begin preparing breakfast while the conversation wraps up.
  * While everyone is sitting down to eat, *Alenia Eldaloth* notes that they should warn *the prince* of their planned arrival in *Caldur*.
  * *Armadyl* uses the magical notebook to contact him and check in, learning they have plans for a raid that evening and could use additional hands if *the party* was interested.
  * Temporarily side-stepping talking about the job, *Armadyl* uses another page to ask where they should meet and learn *the prince* will be starting their day moving around *Caldur* within the next 20 minutes or so.

### To *Caldur*

* *The party* having been informed of their timetable, *Mytejager* quickly runs out of the guesthouse to *Vedelem Temple*.
  * The rest of *the party* follows a bit behind, confused.
  * Arriving there, *Mytejager* pulls *Nallin Torevir* aside to inform him of his interaction with *Erid Loderr* so as not to have the situation turn bad if she comes by.
* Finding a tree near *the temple*, *Alenia Eldaloth* casts Transport Via Plants to take *the party* to the courtyard of *Mourning Dew Keep*.
  * The earlier messaging having left out their arrival location, the guards at *the keep* quickly hone in on *the party*'s arrival with concern before *Prince Grund Caebrek* calls out to join them.
* Walking with *the prince* out of the courtyard and toward his first meeting for the day, *the party* begins to converse and catch up with him.
  * *Fallthra Bigoat* and *Agnew Solidsgurd* (in a comically large-brimmed hat and cloak to block the sun) are with him, helping him with his business here.
  * People have been suspicious of *the prince* and *recent* [events](09.%20Conflicts%20In%20Kereskell\%2862%29.md) in *Caldur*, resulting in some citizens partaking in unrest incited by the leftover remnants of *The Ruby Lash* who fled to *Caldur*.
  * *Fallthra Bigoat* mentions that *Agnew Solidsgurd* hired a mercenary that has been infiltrating their group to find their meeting spaces.
    * *Agnew Solidsgurd* explains he met her after she had been involved in some vigilantism in *Ranafyll* in the last couple months.
  * *Armadyl* questions who the people they'll find at the meeting tonight are, and whether they're criminals.
    * *The prince* explains that several individuals found at these places are wanted, but many haven't actually committed any crimes and are set free after questioning.
    * *Prince Grund Caebrek* also notes these groups have been gathering a large variety of supplies for something, but they haven't figured out what yet.
    * *Armadyl* notes he wants to avoid any more heads on pikes, to which *Prince Grund Caebrek* agrees.
  * *Mytejager* falls slightly behind *Agnew Solidsgurd* to ask if he would be joining the raid and if *the prince* knew of his condition.
    * He will be joining, and neither *the prince* nor *Fallthra Bigoat* know about him.

### Pre-Dinner Preparations

* *Prince Grund Caebrek* invites *the party* to join them for dinner back at *Mourning Dew Keep* as a starting point for the evening's activities, and everyone splits up to go about their day until then.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* asks for a place to make potions and is given a note providing her access to the alchemy lab in *Mourning Dew Keep*.
* *Sennin* and *Mytejager* head to a nearby guardhouse to begin asking about *Arai Yaeldrin*.
  * They learn that he is a member of the *Red Dawn*, but the guard isn't sure what his assignment is as his post is missing in his file.
  * The two are informed that he supposedly reports directly to *Archguard Alexandel Weltzlin*, who is currently stationed at *Mourning Dew Keep*.
  * Heading over to speak with him, *Archguard Alexandel Weltzlin* eventually meets with them and learn that *Arai Yaeldrin*'s post is a secret due to what he guards, and that he can't explain much more than that there are relevant secrets in the lower levels of the keep.
  * *Archguard Alexandel Weltzlin* notes that *Arai Yaeldrin* is off today, but will be stationed again tomorrow and that he'll look into him again.
  * *Sennin* then asks if he could be provided access to a Teleportation Circle, and *Archguard Alexandel Weltzlin* agrees to put in a request to do so.
  * As they leave, *Mytejager* notes that he thought *Sennin* would ask *Archguard Alexandel Weltzlin* about his father's amulet, noting he thinks he may have seen it somewhere before.
* *Armadyl* flies around the city for the day, trying to catch any clues or people of interest, but doesn't see anything of note.
* Eventually, *the party* regroups in the courtyard of *Mourning Dew Keep* for dinner, and are met and escorted inside by *Fallthra Bigoat*.
