### It's A Trap

* Continuing to follow the distressed Firbolg, *the party* was lead to a ridge in the trees.
  * Another Firbolg was up a tree, with several undead creatures surrounding him.
  * Combat began, with *Armadyl* making the swift decision to teleport the Firbolg to the relative safety of the rest of *the party*.
  * Eventually, it was revealed that the two Firbolgs were actually fiends wearing Firbolg bodies, looking to lure in anyone helping them.
  * During the fight, overhearing the commotion, *Colm Rolen* joined the battle.
* *The party* was victorious, and *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* eventually collected a couple heads and a sapling from the deceased.

### Well, He Found Us

* Setting up another camp (with *Sennin* setting up Tiny Hut once again), *the party* began to have a conversation with *Colm Rolen* about what has been going on.
* Learned *Colm Rolen* had been exiled from the *Tala-Raksa Clan* after gaining his warlock powers.
  * A strange magical anomaly was found on the shore of *The Beast's Basin*.
  * Everyone was informed to stay away until their druids could get on the scene to handle it.
  * A bit younger and bolder, *Colm Rolen* approached anyway and passed out.
  * Waking up after having dreams of drowning and a large monster saving him, he had his new powers.
  * *Colm*'s brother still lives with their clan, so he still has attachments, though he hasn't returned before now.
* Also learned about *Prathamika*, and its nature as a invisible village.
  * Illusion magic keeps it hidden from view, while scouting parties will intercept anyone getting too close.
* *The party* decided they would attempt to cross paths with some scouts in the morning, and try to convince them to accept help.
* While finishing their conversations and preparing to go back to sleep, *Colm Rolen* pointed out that *Armadyl* was missing.
  * *B. B.* used Sending to contact him, and the spell succeeded, but got no response.
