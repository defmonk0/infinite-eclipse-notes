### Forgery

* Talked with *Jemir 'Gem' Kenafin*, convincing her to leave with the rest of the slaves and forging their sale bills to set them free.
  * Plan was to later transfer the deed to the house and pretend to be *Amert Godwy* in the meantime via spells.
* *Amert Godwy*'s corpse was buried under some nightshade in the greenhouse.
* *Armadyl* was given the tour by *Jemir 'Gem' Kenafin* to get an idea of what was there, and what was hidden.

### Exploration

* *Infinite Eclipse* went up to *Amert Godwy*'s room and found/opened the safe via some safe-cracking from *Rivian*.
  * Inside was:
    * Deed to the house
    * Bag of 700 platinum
    * Diamond worth 300 gold
    * Tuning fork attuned to the material plane
* Scoped out the dungeon, finding a few skeletons but little else.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* also buried them in the greenhouse, opposite the nightshade.
* A hidden potion room was explored, finding a few intact potions.
  * 2x potions of healing (1x potion of poison, given to *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* and marked as uncertain)
  * 1x unknown potion (potion of stone giant strength)
* Checked the *magic items* in the library.
  * After some careful trap disarming and opening from *Rivian*, *Sennin* identified the items.
  * The identify didn't work on the items quite like normal, bombarding *Sennin* with information that became indecipherable.
  * Other than the name of the items, their attunement requirements, and their divinely magical nature, little could be found.
    * The wristlet in the glass dome was *Sapientia's Lunar Wristlet*.
    * The crown in the other glass dome was the *Crown of Segnis*
    * The book from *Amert Godwy* was the *Charta Infinitus*.
  * Some brief history/legend of each of the items could be found in the library after some research.
  * *Sennin* immediately attuned to *Charta Infinitus*, being familiar with the legend.

### Sleep

* *Armadyl* and *Alenia Eldaloth* were still skeptical about their items after learning their nature.
* *The party* then went to sleep, finding places throughout the large estate.
* *Armadyl* prayed and requested an audience with *Birkoziik* before sleep.
  * Shortly after drifting off, a familiar white space acted as their meeting place.
  * Asked about the *magic items* they found, and their skepticism of them.
  * *Birkoziik* explained they were meant as boons for their champions at the time, so it made little sense for any severe curses to be placed on them.
  * Additionally, *Birkoziik* was amused at the idea of using one of *Mharu*'s boons as a means to work against him, noting that perhaps *Isdaima* was rubbing off on him a bit.

### Making Ourselves At Home

* The following morning, *the party* decided to spend the day working around the house to prepare for the coming days.
* *Armadyl* informed *Alenia Eldaloth* of his conversation with *Birkoziik*, assuring her it wasn't cursed.
* *Armadyl* gave *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* the periapt of wound closure, and then attuned to the *Crown of Segnis*.
* At the door, *Berric* waited.
  * Stated he had no where to go, and offered to stick around to take care of the house while they were gone.
  * In return, he got housing and food.
  * *The party* agreed, and mentioned they should teach him to defend himself.
* *Rivian* forged the deed to the manor, in case it becomes needed.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* used detect magic to finish checking the house, and then using Plant Growth to make them healthier.
* *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* taught *Berric* some basic self-defense and bow usage.
* *Armadyl* did some flying around to scope out the graveyard and the drug tavern.
  * The graveyard only had the basic visitors, and the tavern alley was completely empty.
  * Informed *the party* of this.

### You Know Who Else Likes His Home?

* After learning the alley was empty, *the party* decided they would check on that the following day.
* In the meantime, the group decided to go visit and question 'Mr. Go Home', the man who was delivering the drug stash to the bar that *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* had followed home.
* Finishing the strategy meeting and planning to get on with it, *the party* left the manor and the session ended.
