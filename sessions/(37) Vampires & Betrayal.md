### Aftermath

* Everyone at the table was unmoving except: *Ergan Ilukar*, *Aureann Gwemonds*, *Agnew Solidsgurd*, *Fallthra Bigoat*, *Prince Grund Caebrek*, and *Lady Arin Raga*.
* Guards rushed in to begin trying to assist and fight the individuals above.
* Everyone who was only unconscious was discovered and assisted.
* Three were dead.
  * *Ki'yorl Nirinath*: Brought back to life by *Alenia Eldaloth* with a diamond from *Aureann Gwemonds*.
  * *Tethren Ignominy*: Brought back by a priest brought in to assist with a diamond they brought.
  * *Dayeren Underwood*: Brought back to life by *Alenia Eldaloth* with a diamond from the priest.
* *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* and *Sennin* accompanied *Fallthra Bigoat* to investigate the bodies of the attackers.
  * *Sennin* determined they were either wizards or sorcerers.
  * Additionally, they didn't have tattoos, but did have fresh brands of *The Ruby Lash*'s whip logo.
  * *Fallthra Bigoat* explained they've had some issues with unrest from *The Ruby Lash* members in the last few days after it was discovered 4 of their upper management was killed, with the 5th seemingly on the run for the crime.
* *Fallthra Bigoat* said *the party* would be escorted home for the night while investigations continue when they're ready.
* *The party* checked in on *Prince Grund Caebrek*.
  * It's decided the trip will be cut short, and his party will be returning to *Machairi* in the morning.
* *Armadyl* used detect thoughts to read the room for a bit to see what could be found.
  * *Prince Grund Caebrek* was a bit shaken, and focused on their methods of return (arcane teleportation).
  * *Aureann Gwemonds* was sort of conflicted about everyone surviving.
* *Sennin* sent an Illusory Script letter to *Balazar Lasa* via *Prince Grund Caebrek*.
* *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* tried to force an answer out of *Agnew Solidsgurd* about how they found *the party*, and his answer was simply that "You're a big man, you're not hard to follow".
* *the party* gathered their escort and began to head back to *The Antumbral Aerie*.
  * On the way out, *Armadyl* messaged *the prince* as his conscious again, saying "I like those guys...", to which he agreed.

### Interview With A Vampire

* After settling in to *Sennin*'s Tiny Hut in the entertainment space for the night, the party took watches through their rest.
* During *Armadyl*'s watch, he noticed a bat was flying around the house aimlessly.
* Trying to let it out, he opened a window to give it a path, but it slunk into the shadows and came back out to reveal itself as *Agnew Solidsgurd*.
* *Armadyl* woke the rest of *the party* and a conversation ensued.
  * *Agnew Solidsgurd* is *Griswold Dusange*, a member of the *Dusange Vampire Clan*.
  * He wants *Morwenna Dusange* (*Aureann Gwemonds*) dead and wants the party's help to do it.
  * In return all of *the party*'s previous interactions with *Black Buck* will be wiped clean as they return to their more subtle means of work.
  * Also discussed taking care of the *young drow man*, *Halis*, ahead of time so they don't have to engage both at once.
* After the party agreed and the broken window was boarded up, everyone continued their night of rest.

### Keeping Things Believable

* A messenger brought a letter containing the schedule of what *Halis* should be up to for the next few days.
  * *The party* decided another drug drop-off that night would be a good time to strike.
* *The party* went to the graveyard they originally fought *Halis* at to make it look like they were chasing any lead you had left for the afternoon.
  * In the downtime, *the party* emptied the bag of holding to clear out some space and the rotting heads.
  * Also, the party noticed they were being Scry'd upon.
* Returning to the city in the late afternoon, the session ended.
