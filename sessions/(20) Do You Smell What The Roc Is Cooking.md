### Oh. Right. There's A Stone Giant.

* *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* set up some hunting traps and spoke with the giant as it rounded the corner.
* Got some basic information from him
  * Basic directions, including an upcoming split in the road.
  * Location of *Meriele Iranapha*'s tower.
  * What types of creatures in the area he would be afraid of.
  * Goliath clans in the area being further north.
* Had him go around *the party*'s camp and avoided combat.
* Went back to sleep to finish the rest.

### Mountain Travel Is Dangerous

* Woke up and took a fast pace through the mountains.
* Eventually came to the fork in the road.
  * *Infinite Eclipse* decided to take the thin path around the mountain rather than the tunnel through it.
* Had some close calls with several people falling, though everyone eventually made it to the other side safely.
* Continued on along the top of a ridge line breaking cloud cover.

### Is It *Supposed* To Be Broken?

* Could see the tower in the distance.
  * Large, circular, stone tower with a crystal fallen and embedded into the top of it.
* Took a hike through a valley under cloud cover and back up to reach the peak holding the tower.
* Went inside, and met an unseen servant of *Meriele Iranapha* who communicates through a book on a pedestal in the entry parlor.
  * *Meriele Iranapha* was still in the middle of an astral projection and was not reachable.
  * Left word of *the party*'s arrival, their situation, and an update on *Balazar Lasa*'s circumstances.
* *The party* stayed in the tower for the night, one floor up, in a sizable entertaining room.
  * Couldn't go any higher in the tower without *Meriele Iranapha*'s magic allowing it.
  * Went poking around a bit, but didn't find anything of note.
* Settled down for bed.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth*, *Armadyl*, and *Sennin* studied languages.
    * As part of the practice, *Alenia Eldaloth* asked *Sennin* about what libraries he's been too.
    * Only main one he had access to was the collection of his previous master, *Amert Godwy*.
    * Mostly contained reading of an arcane nature, but was an underground personal library of two floors, with the second being a loft, and doubled as a reading room.
    * *Alenia Eldaloth* suggested stopping by *Aethia* after they finish they job in *Mastow*, to be able to show the library there.
  * *Florian* poked around being a bit nosy.
  * *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* continued to talk with the servant.
    * Questioning about stories of *Balazar Lasa* and *Meriele Iranapha*.
      * *Balazar Lasa* was in training with *Meriele Iranapha* since a young age.
    * Asked about the crystal in the top of the tower.
      * Was originally magically suspended above the tower.
      * Fell at some point, collapsing into the top couple floors of the tower.
      * Had been decades since it had happened.
* *Party* finished up their nightly routines, and went to sleep.

### We Want To Kill Something

* Woke up the following morning and prepared to continue the hike.
* *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* asked about an easier way to return in the future.
  * There isn't much an easier way on foot, but the servant led *Sennin* to a teleportation circle in an armoire, and let him copy it for use later.
* Returning through the valley and back to the ridge, *the party* continued eastward.
* At some point in the afternoon, *the party* noticed a mountain lion stalking them.
  * A few people wanted to kill it, joking about needing a fix.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* spoke to it, and ran it off.
* The remainder of the day was mostly uneventful, with *the party* eventually setting up camp for the night.
  * *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell*, during his watch, emptied the bag of holding to get an idea of what was really in it.
    * Other than *the party*'s belongings, there was:
      * 150 to 200 doses of suude.
      * A large femur, likely belonging to some variety of dinosaur.
    * Returned everything but the artifact to the bag.
  * *Samantha Carter* and *Armadyl* had the final watch, during which they heard the cries of some kind of large bird of prey in the distance.

### We Didn't Mean Something That Big

* Waking up again, *the party* once again continued east.
* Uneventful travel through the first half of the day.
* During the last couple hours of travel, *Samantha Carter* eventually noticed a shadow overtake the space.
  * Would generally assume it was a cloud, but upon looking up, it was a massive bird hovering above.
  * *Florian* made a distraction with an illusory giant pig.
  * The bird swooped in so fast, everyone gave up on running.
  * *The party* decided to engage, entering full combat with the [Roc](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/roc) that had taken note of them.
  * A very stressful battle ensued, but eventually *Armadyl* got the killing blow.
* *The party* grouped up, and took a short rest.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* used some of her *Dried Aethic Herbs* to help heal *the party*.
* The session ended.
