### On The Way Out

* *The party* continued their walk eastward out of *Kereskell*.
* At the gate, just before leaving, *the party* noted someone was watching them and very poorly attempting to be inconspicuous.
* *B. B.* decided to confront the guy with *Mytejager* and *Ergan Ilukar* in tow.
* A few excuses and veiled attempt at hitting on *B. B.*, the confrontation didn't amount to much, so *the party* moved on left as intended.
* On the way out, *Rivian* had *Beaks* keep an eye on the individual to know whether he followed them, which he did not.

### Surveilled Travel

* A short bit into the walk towards *Argelen*, *Alenia Eldaloth* suggested passing through the *Westwood* to possibly save some travel time, and because the walk might be nicer & more interesting, to which *the party* agreed.
* Arriving at the edge of the *Westwood* by sundown, *the party* settled in to camp for the night using *Sennin*'s Tiny Hut.
* During the night, *Samantha Carter* noticed a crow that appeared to be watching the Tiny Hut.
* *Samantha Carter* attempted to cast Speak With Animals to interact with it, but it did not respond to her greetings.
* *Samantha Carter* woke up *Alenia Eldaloth* to try and figure out what was going on, and *Alenia Eldaloth* summoned *Tempris* to handle it.
* The crow promptly exploded into a cloud of dust and it became apparent that it was not a natural crow.
* *Alenia Eldaloth*, worried, quickly woke up the rest of *the party*, who were not as disturbed and simply went back to sleep due to the safety that Tiny Hut provides.

* Continuing the trek through the woods, *B. B.* took point leading *the party* with ease.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* spoke with the trees to try and scope out any possible dangers in the forest, learning the general active nature of its bounds.
* Around mid-day, *Armadyl* noticed a black bird high in the sky, following *the party*.
* Checking it out, it was confirmed to once again be the crow (which tried to keep its distance), and *Armadyl* made quick work of it before returning and informing *the party*.
* The rest of the day's travel was uneventful, so *the party* once again set up camp with Tiny Hut.
* *Mytejager* and *Rivian* took first watch, and once again heard a bird keeping perimeter nearby, and woke *Armadyl*.
* *Armadyl* suggests searching stuff to see if anyone has been tagged in some way that it would make it easy to track them, while *Mytejager* went out to take care of the bird again.
* Returning inside, *Mytejager* searches his own stuff to keep the *Crown of Segnis* hidden, and no one finds anything.
* Once again, on the next watch, *Ergan Ilukar* and *B. B.* heard the bird, which prompts *B. B.* to stay up afterward, not getting a long rest for the second night in a row, exhausting her.

### *Eline's Roses*

* Near the end of the final watch, around dawn, not long before everyone would have normally woke up and just barely completing their long rests, *Armadyl* and *B. B.* heard approaching footsteps and woke the rest of *the party*.
* *An elf woman* approached (with *several individuals* trailing her) beginning a brief but tense conversation about coming out of the dome, to which *the party* refused, prompting her to use Dispel Magic to remove it.
* This began battle between the two groups began, trading spells and some very powerful hits.
* During the battle, *Armadyl* realized he couldn't use the *Crown of Segnis* and that he no longer had it.
* As the battle was waning, with only the two heavy hitters remaining (*Eline* and *Tizin*, names learned from shouted commands during the battle), *Armadyl* tried a plan using Banishment to hopefully stop the fighting.
* The plan did not go as hoped, resulting in several people going unconscious, including *Sennin* (twice), *Samantha Carter*, and *Armadyl* (who almost died), and *Tizin* on the enemy side.
* Becoming desperate, *Eline* teleported herself and *Tizin* away from the fight to try and save him, giving *the party* time to take care of themselves as well.
* Just in time, *Alenia Eldaloth* poured a healing potion into *Armadyl*'s mouth, bringing him to consciousness and prompting a whisper in his head:
  * "Now that was cutting it a little close, wasn't it?"
* Noting the two of them had visually disappeared, *the party* regrouped to figure out what to do.
