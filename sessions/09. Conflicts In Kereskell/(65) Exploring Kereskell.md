### A Much Needed Rest

### The Final Stretch

* Continuing the next day, travel began down from the mountains at high elevation, letting up the heavy trek through snow.
* Along the way, *Ergan Ilukar* postulated that some of *the party* might want to offer their souls up to his sword for the sake of more power, though everyone turned him down.
* Another night of camping was prepared not more than a few hours out from the city.
* While settling down for the night, *Armadyl* received a message via the Sending Stone from *Niefendil*.
  * "Hello *Armadyl*. Figured I'd honor our relationship and keep you updated. We found interesting legends in *Teorainn*. The Gnarlwood and *Aon's Maw* are worth investigating."
  * "Good evening. Much obliged; your good will is appreciated. We approach *Kereskell*, but have plans to visit Torainn soon. Any particular details?"
  * "Not much more than strange happenings, possibly other remnants, but worth looking into nonetheless."
  * "OK, cool; thanks."

### Arriving In *Kereskell*

* The following morning, *the party* started their walk and not more than a few hours later, began to peak past the final mountains overlooking *Kereskell*.
* *The party* arrived in the city around noon, and quickly made a beeline for *Kereskell University*.
  * Arriving there and passing through the parks surrounding the campus, *the party* soon found themselves glowing and sticking out.
  * *Sennin* attempted to use Dispel Magic to remove the glow, but it simply came back after a few seconds.
  * Not long after arriving, *the party* was approached by *an Elvin woman*, *Agatha* inquiring what business you had.
  * *The party* wanted to request access to *the university*'s materials, specifically the library, in their assistance to *Prince Grund Caebrek*.
  * *Agatha* explains that access is not given freely, though they could try contacting a dean or some alumni to try and get special permission or information indirectly.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* asked about *the druid* she was looking for, and, with some distaste, you were given his name, and additionally the name of the dean he worked under, *Augusta Tullus*, Dean of Order, *Lorehold College*, as possible contacts.
  * Finally, before leaving, you were offered and requested a tour, available around the same time the next day.

### Gathering Information

* Next stop was a guardhouse stationed in front of the *Far Gates*.
  * *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* requested some information, and was accommodated surprisingly easily.
  * Asking about *Adam Root*, this location didn't have anything on him.
  * Pretending it was an alternate name for the same person, *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* then asked about *Hart Zech*.
    * He was arrested for pickpocketing about a year ago, but hasn't been on the *Red Dawn*'s radar since.
    * Last known address was a place in *Hapishane Row*.
    * Explained the main archives in *Ceannaire Heights* would have taxation information if that could be useful.
  * Also requested a messenger service *the party* could use, and was offered *Kereskell Calls* on the edge of the *Ganlion Bazaar*.
  * *Sennin* also inquired about his amulet, though the guard had nothing of note for that either.
* Wrapping up there, *the party* head up the hill towards *Ceannaire Heights* to pay a visit to the administrative buildings.
  * Little else was gathered there, though *the party* did ask a passing guard for recommendations on places to drink and sleep.
  * *B. B.* got distracted by a winery, and drug everyone inside to try and get a drink.
  * Disappointed that it was the place the wine was made, and not a place for drinking, *the party* got additional recommendations for places to go and moved on.

### A Quick Break For Drinks

* Wanting to stop and write letters for people at *the university* and have a drink, *the party* made their way to *The Kinky Witch*.
* Once there, *B. B.* ordered the most expensive bottle of wine, while the rest of *the party* got *Mastow Ale*.
  * The wine was intense, numbing the mouth quite significantly and being very effective at its job.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* wrote the letters to be sent to *Augusta Tullus* and *Manfred*.
* *Sennin*, answering some questions about how he is looking for *his father*, pulled out his amulet to show *the party*.
  * The owner/bartender woman, *Nadaladalan Baharoosh*, or just *Nadala* for short, quickly perked up having noticed the symbol, and revealed that she has her own identical amulet.
  * She explains that she got it from a dark elf named *Feari* who she spent time with while he was in the city for a few months, about 2 years ago.
  * One day he just left, explaining if she ever wanted to find him again, she simply need to look.
    * She had been considering selling the bar to do exactly that recently.
  * She was told his previous two stops were *Mastow* and *Argelen* on his travels.

### A Place To Stay

* *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* suggests *Sennin* use the Ring of the Scrying Eye to look for his father.
  * Attempting it, the spell fails for some reason, but *Sennin* is unsure what reason caused it.
* Looking for a place to crash for the night, *the party* was recommended *The Inn Of The Mighty Sword* by *Nadala* as it is owned by a friend.
* Taking that advice, *the party* started to head out, needing to pay their tab.
  * *B. B.* tried to magic her way out of paying, but *the party* quickly put a stop to it, *Alenia Eldaloth* paid, and everyone left.
* Arriving, *the party* discovers that *the woman behind the bar* is a Goliath.
  * *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell*, excited, gets 3 nights of rooms for *the party* and settle in. 
  * While hanging out and sampling the wine, there was a circumstance where *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell*'s hands began to turn purple from it.
    * After fixing his hands, *Sennin* went the experimental route to see where it would continue to go, though it just subsided on its own over time.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* and *B. B.* go to deliver the letters to *Kereskell Calls*.
  * Stop at the *Cyfnos Tree* along the way to say hello.
    * Tree pointed out that the *Festival of Silence* is not far off.
    * Learned another druid comes by and speaks to it every once in a while as well, but doesn't know their name.
  * Dropping the letters off afterward is uneventful, and the two of them regroup with *the party*.
* While most of *the party* tries to make plans for the rest of the night and the next day, *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* attempts to befriend *Bethrynna 'Rolegureinn' Aspenshard*.
  * She is very short and dismissive, seemingly unhappy to be dealing with another Goliath.
  * *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* tries to start conversation and brag a bit with the heads he's collected, but the conversation is cut short and he moves away abruptly once she reveals she was exiled from her clan.
* Wrapping up the planning and finishing any food and drinks, *the party* continued to simply hang out at their table.
