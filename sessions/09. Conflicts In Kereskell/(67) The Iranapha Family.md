### Meeting *Manfred*

* *The party*, entering *The Inn Of Mighty Sword*, began having a conversation with *Manfred Iranapha*.
  * Learned he is, in fact, *Meriele Iranapha*'s brother.
    * Hasn't seen her in hundreds of years.
  * His following of *The Old Faith* stemmed from his mother, who was also a follower.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* learned of the general flexibility of following *The Old Faith*.
  * *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* asked where he was from, and *Manfred Iranapha* responded with the *Westwood*, south of *Kereskell*.
  * Learned more of his research and work at *Kereskell University*.
    * Specifically looking into the general limitations of the gods as a way to contextualize their worship.
    * Stems from his more objective look at them since he is a follower of a faith that doesn't involve them.
  * Learned of two examples *Manfred Iranapha* has notes on as the sort of things he looks for as clues to learning more.
    * First example involved *a dragonborn cleric* based out of *Teorainn*.
    * The second example involved *two* *boys* at an orphanage in *Arahaam*.
  * Learned the legend about the *Cyfnos Tree*, including how its believed to have been a gift between the gods.
  * Learned that *Plargg* worships *Raavasa*.
  * *Manfred Iranapha* agreed to look up information on the *desiccated worms* *the party* is investigating.
  * *Manfred Iranapha* also clocked that *B. B.* was from the Feywild.
    * This concerned her, so she pulled him aside to ask how.
    * He explained that, while most people might not be able to tell the difference between an Eladrin and an Elf, educated individuals with a penchant for magic and study of living beings could spot the tell-tale signs.
    * She also asked if he had ever been to the Feywild before, to which he confirmed.
    * *Manfred Iranapha* also asked if *B. B.* had a way back, and if she wanted to return home, to which she was not sure yet.

### Crown Swap

* Before heading to bed, *the party* started making plans about heading to *Argelen* next.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* made a healing potion, but was unable to figure out the *the weird alchemical tool* she was given yet.
* During watches, *Rivian* noticed the *Crown of Segnis* on *Armadyl*'s head had changed at some point.
  * Just to prank a bit, he ended up taking it and putting it on *Mytejager*'s head before his watch came to an end.
  * In the morning, upon noticing, *Mytejager* hid the *Crown of Segnis* in his bag.
* Gathering in the morning, most of *the party* ate breakfast while *Mytejager* found food elsewhere before starting their day around town.

### Chores

* *Mytejager* picked up his baby Purple Worm head.
* *The party* decided to try and get access to a teleportation circle in *Kereskell*, so they went to ask the guards about it.
  * In *Ceannaire Heights*, *the party* eventually were directed to *Archguard Cressel Reverence*.
  * Recognizing *Ergan Ilukar* and the general work *the party* has done for *Kereskell* and stories of their familiarity with *Prince Grund Caebrek*, he decided to work with them to get them access.
  * Using a quick return in the case of urgent developments in *the party*'s investigation of *The Hallowed Remnants* as an excuse, *Archguard Cressel Reverence* filled out the paperwork and led them to the locked chamber within one of the *Red Dawn* buildings in the city that houses their teleportation circle.
    * He also warned that *the party* should send a message ahead of time to warn them of their coming so they don't take defensive measures upon an unexpected arrival.
* After wrapping up there, *Mytejager* and *Ergan Ilukar* went to the administrative buildings to request information on *Fol Narkag* and *Adam Root*.
  * Learned that *Fol Narkag* is a retired businessman and previous proprietor of *Argelen Grand Jewler*, which has been passed down in the family.
  * On *Adam Root*, *the party* learned that he is a more general trade merchant for wares and raw materials, and had a minor record for tax evasion from what was determined to be an accidental missed payment.
* Preparing to head out of town, *the party* split to handle some last minute things.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* (with *B. B.*) went back to the *Cyfnos Tree* to say goodbye since they wouldn't be in town long enough to see the *Festival of Silence* celebrations.
  * The rest of *the party* went to *Kama Port* to try and spot *The Ashen Serpent* in case it was in town.
    * Could have acted as a possible reference and lead for information on where *The Skull Of Razaro* came from.
    * Found *The Copper Coin*, but not *The Ashen Serpent*.
* *The party* met back up, and began making their way eastward back through *the city* and towards the *Far Gates*.
