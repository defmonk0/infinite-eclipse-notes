### Preparing For Rest

* Separating to their rooms, *the party* began preparing for bed.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* tried making another healing potion, but was unable to complete it.
* *Armadyl* received a message on the Sending Stone.
  * "The forest is haunted. They're protecting something. Artlaag had to turn back. There could be strength in numbers, if you and your friends have interest."
  * "Noted. As per my last message, we are in *Kereskell* for some business, but I hope to convince *the party* to make for there soon."
  * "No rush, of course. We simply haven't the time to have the three of us in one place at the moment. I look forward to it."
  * "Until next time, then."

### A Surprise In The Night

* Bedding down for rest, individuals in one room took watches to keep an eye on *Ergan Ilukar* through the night.
  * The other room did not do the same.
* During the second watch, *Samantha Carter* was stabbed in her sleep by *an assassin* who had snuck in.
  * Her Crossbow of Warning did not go off.
  * *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* was on watch at the time, and heard the struggle from the other room.
  * Rushing over, he found the assassin standing over *Samantha Carter* in bed, right as *Samantha Carter* died from her wounds.
  * Engaging the assassin and waking up the others, *the party* eventually captures and restrains the assassin.
  * Once the issue was contained, *Alenia Eldaloth* began the spell required to bring *Samantha Carter* back to life.
    * *Alenia Eldaloth* also realized that two of the diamonds had been pickpocketed off of her in the city at some point.
* Interrogating the assassin using both mundane and arcane means, *the party* realized he was sent by *The Covenant*.
  * Got little in the way of leads on where to start investigating and chasing them down.
  * Once done with him, *Armadyl*, remembering *Mharu*'s words ("Some deserveÂ **death**." - *Waterfall Scene*), slashed the assassin's throat open with his claws before heading out of the room.
  * Not quite enough to kill him, *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* finished the job as not to watch him suffer.
* *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* then went to the worker at the bar below to fetch the guards.
  * They mostly accepted the situation at face value due to the presence of *Ergan Ilukar* and *Samantha Carter*, took statements, and then removed the body.
  * Meanwhile, *Armadyl* cast Divination, asking "Is that what you want of me?".
    * A response came, stating "Take it at your own pace, but I certainly find the evolution intriguing."
* Reassembling in one room, *the party* had a quick debrief before returning to sleep to finish out their rest.
  * Decided there wasn't much more to be done at this point, but to expect something different again in the future since the assassin had failed.

### A Rushed Morning

* *The party* slept in a bit after the eventful night, leaving less time before their scheduled tour of *Kereskell University*.
* Most ate breakfast downstairs, but *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* went to find breakfast elsewhere to avoid patronizing the establishment any futher.
* Finishing up and heading out, some quick shopping was done on the way to *the university*.
  * *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* rush-ordered preservation of his baby purple worm head.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* attempted to buy additional diamonds to restock, but was unable to do so in time.
  * *B. B.* found a bookstore to buy *Alenia Eldaloth* a gift, deciding it would by funny to buy some corny smut, and eventually deciding on "Regarding the Famous Anals of the City", which **was not** a typo.
* Regrouping, *B. B.* gave *Alenia Eldaloth* her gift.

### The Tour

* Arriving at *Kereskell University*, *B. B.* attempted to see if Disguise Self could fool the security of the campus, and it could not.
* Eventually, *the party* was seen and greeted by *Professor Losheel*, who temporarily disabled the security glow for everyone.
* The tour began, discussing the history of *the university*.
  * *The party* was particularly intrigued by the *Founding Dragons*, and the multi-planar campus.
  * Learned about *The Biblioplex*, how access is restricted to those associated with *the university*, and that it keeps records of all recommendations and access.
  * Learned that *Manfred*'s area of study involves proving the faults of the gods, and many at *the university* take issue with that.
  * Learned that the counterpart to *Augusta Tullus*, Dean of Order, is *Plargg*, Dean of Chaos (within *Lorehold College*), and is one of the main academics on the *Pantheistic War* at *the university*.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* received *a weird alchemical tool* from *Professor Willowdusk*, and was told it would help her with her potion making.
  * *Armadyl* attempted to get a recommendation from *Professor Willowdusk*, and was told to visit a few more times and she'd think about it.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth*, noting her distaste for the gods, was told she should meet *Manfred*, and that she worries about how lonely he is after *his sister* left.
* Completing the tour, *Losheel* and *the party* went their separate ways.

### Return To The Inn

* On the way back to *The Inn Of The Mighty Sword*, unburdened by a schedule this time, *Alenia Eldaloth* eventually found and bought 600 gold worth of raw diamonds.
* Arriving, *the party* was met by two guards out front.
  * Seeing *Alenia Eldaloth*, the guards began to stand at attention, but then relaxed again after seeing *Ergan Ilukar* as well.
  * One of them peaked their head in the door, and said "I think you're alright *Manfred*. She seems to be traveling with one of ours."
