### A Short Return Detour

* Slept, returned to road in the morning from the base of the mountains.
* Split the party with most heading north.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* and *Florian* head back to *Caldur*.
  * Quicker to send a couple people via *Chestnut* to drop off ears and heads.
* Nearing *Caldur*, A *young drow man* heading north hands over a letter for *Infinite Eclipse*.
  * Stated to be a parcel from his mistress.
  * Gave little information when pried by *Florian*.

 > 
 > Hello *Infinite Eclipse*,
 > 
 > I have heard you have done well and gone to great lengths in understanding the plight of one *Gilian Edmur*. His contract with us has obviously gone unfinished, but we still felt the need to clean up his mess a bit.
 > 
 > You were surprisingly swift in discovering what you have so far, and so congratulations are in order. It would have been ideal if no one ever knew of our involvement with that glorified clocksmith, but alas. 
 > 
 > We of the Dusange Family would humbly request that you not dig any further. We're not ones to make a habit of blotting out the light of promising upstarts, and would much prefer you go about your own business.
 > 
 > And leave us to ours.
 > 
 > ---
 > 
 > Signed,

 > *Morwenna Dusange*

* While approaching the city, smoke could be seen rising from the southern side.

### An Interrogation

* The guards happily paid for the death of both the goblins and the ettin.
* *Archguard Alexandel Weltzlin* and *5th Stratum Melanthos Leva* return with their money and require some questioning about *Tick Tock Clock Stock*.
* Surrounded by guards, *Alenia Eldaloth* and *Florian* agree and follow them into the wall.
* Once inside, the two guards explain they just needed to put on a show of bringing them in for questioning.
* *Tick Tock Clock Stock* was burned down in the night and *Lord Bar Todt*, who owns the land, is making a stink about it.
* They can't really investigate into the shop any longer (it's a smoldering wreck in a large hole), so they check up on some basic facts to make sure they understand *Infinite Eclipse*'s story.
* The two guards let them go out a back door after some time passes, to look like they did more, even though they had little doubts about the party.
* On the way out of the city, a map was purchased at *Mourning Dew Keep* of all of *Semoor* from *Miles Jerner*.
* The two missing members reunite with the rest of the group, and set up for camp.
* In the night, during a watch, *Alenia Eldaloth* comes across some [Deinonychus](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/deinonychus) eating a ox-like corpse (a dead [Aurochs](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/aurochs)) a bit away from camp. 
* The dinosaurs fled once they heard *Alenia Eldaloth*, who had snuck up on them.

### Conflicting Emotions

* In the morning, due to an unfortunate natural 1, *Florian* forgot entirely to disguise himself from the party.
* This enabled many of them to quickly determine he was the individual who attacked *Sennin* during the *Sowing Festival* when they all met.
* Many were upset at this revelation, though *Florian* brushed it off, but no one took action since *Sennin* himself didn't attempt anything.
* The party continued onward, eventually coming across a seemingly abandoned house and garden on the frontier.
* Exploring a bit, *Florian* and *Beaks* ate some tomatoes from the garden, and *Ergan Ilukar* packed up a couple days worth of produce for the road.
* Looking through the window, a half eaten meal was left on the table. Exploring inside the unlocked building a bit, a dead body was discovered in bed.
* *Beaks* was preemptively unsummoned. *Florian* quickly became sick and began taking damage.
* Debating it for a few moments, *Alenia Eldaloth* healed him, which also removed this particular poison. He was fine.
* *Ergan Ilukar* removed the food he had taken, and burned down the building and garden to stop anyone else from making the same mistake, giving the man inside a makeshift funeral pyre.
* *Infinite Eclipse* continued northeast, towards *Machairi*, preparing once again to make camp a couple hours later.
