### Catching Up

* After regrouping, *the party* started walking back to the meetup point for the mission.
  * *Sennin* carried *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell*'s passed out exhausted form on a Floating Disk.
* On the way, *Armadyl* was briefly filled in on *Ergan Ilukar*'s incident with the fire breath and sword.
* Arriving at the meetup, 2 of the 4 groups were already there (*the party* now being the 3rd).
* *Armadyl* introduced himself, and helped heal one of the Firbolgs that had gotten hurt.
  * Continuing the conversation with *Fithic Rolen*, *Armadyl* explained to him and *the party* he had read one of the creature's minds.
  * There was some kind of compulsion to leave the Shadowfell, pushing them through the rift.
* A short bit later, the 4th group arrived having had a couple casualties, but the large group began heading back toward *Prathamika*.
  * On the walk, *the party* began questioning ways to help get *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* back into fighting shape for the rift closing scheduled for the next day.
  * Options included spells from one of the more powerful druids with them, and possibly even potions from local alchemists.
    * The elders would be notified to see what could be done.
* *Armadyl* has a brief exchange with *Colm Rolen* via Message, and learned of his situation with the rest of the village.
* Arriving in *Prathamika*, the group split up.
  * *Fithic Rolen* headed to the elders to report.
  * *Ereth Sparkheart*, the druid *the party* has been interacting with, showed *the party* to a military tent they could use to spend the night in.
    * Also set up plans to meet up the next day to teach *Alenia Eldaloth* the rift-closing magic they will be using.
* *Rivian* re-summoned *Beaks* in the fire pit, and then everyone settled in for a nights rest.

### Druid Training

* In the late hours of the night, being up late after sleeping all day, *Armadyl* secretly cast Divination, though didn't get much guidance from its use.
* The rest of *the party* awoke, and began to go about their business for the day.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* and *Armadyl* met up with *Ereth Sparkheart* and had some breakfast.
  * Afterward, they gathered *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* and split up.
  * *Armadyl* escorted the exhausted *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* to the *Fern Frond Apothecary* at the recommendation of the elders, and got a Potion of Vitality for him (among some other shopping).
  * *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* then went to find *Colm Rolen*, while *Armadyl* went to the training grounds to regroup with and watch *Alenia Eldaloth*'s training montage.
  * While waiting around, *Armadyl* decided to have some entertainment messing with one of the guards who was made to keep an eye on him, eventually befriending him and slipping him some cash.
  * Meanwhile, *B. B.* went looking for Holy Water, but was unable to find any.

### Through The Tree

* After dinner, the party regrouped in the meeting tent to start executing plans to head to the rift.
  * It was decided the party and the druids would use *Ereth Sparkheart*'s Transport Via Plants to right into the middle of the area with the rift, as close as possible.
* Arriving at a tree in town large enough to get through, everyone prepared for the battle.
  * Mage Armor was cast on *Sennin* and *Rivian*.
  * Invisibility was set up on *Rivian* and *Armadyl*.
  * See Invisibility was activated by *Sennin*.
  * Bark Skin and *Tempris* were prepared by *Alenia Eldaloth*.
* When everyone was ready, *Ereth Sparkheart* opened the portal through the tree, and everyone went through.
* On the other side, the party was immediately noticed by the creates present, and a fight began.
