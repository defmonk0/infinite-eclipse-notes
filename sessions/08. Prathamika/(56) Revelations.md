### *Armadyl*'s Turmoil

* *Armadyl* flew as quickly as he could northward, eventually arriving at the waterfall used by his people during their religious migrations.
* Torn apart by his recent crises, he lashed out at the falls, yelling for answers.
* Eventually, getting nowhere, he begrudgingly sat under the waterfall to begin meditating and calming down.
* Some hours later, still under the falls, he slipped into a dream-like state similar to the one he gets while speaking with *Birkoziik, The Steadfast*.
* Taking in the dream, another figure joined him, eventually revealing himself as *Mharu, The Apathetic*.
* Learned it was likely him who spoke to *Armadyl* in Carceri, telling him to use the soul vials to escape.
* Eventually, working with the *Crown of Segnis*, *Mharu* brings the item to its awakened state.
* His parting words were, on the subject of *Birkoziik*, "You've done *him* proud. You've done *us* proud."
* Waking from the dream and contemplating on what happened for a bit, *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* eventually arrives having walked and tracked him across *The Beast's Basin*.
  * They move to meet each other part-way, and *Armadyl* hides the crown under his hood.
  * *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* asks what's been up recently, and *Armadyl* explains the situation with the souls he used to escape Carceri.
  * *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* explains that *Birkoziik* was worried and asked him to keep an eye on him and *Ergan Ilukar*.
  * Getting ready to leave, *Armadyl* passed out from exhaustion and *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* began carrying him back.

### *Prathamika*

* Meanwhile, the rest of *the party* gets themselves together after *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* departed to find *Armadyl*.
* Before departing, *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* requested *Alenia Eldaloth* keep an eye on *Ergan Ilukar* for him.
* *The party* heard sounds of battle and howling in the distance, so they, along with *Colm Rolen*, went to go investigate.
* They eventually found a group of Firbolg scouts engaging some Shadow Mastiffs.
* *Colm Rolen* revealed one of those among the scouts was his brother, *Fithic Rolen*, and everyone rushed in to join the fight.
  * The Shadow Mastiffs, seeing the changing tide of the battle, quickly decided to make a run for it instead of continuing the engagement.
* After some conversations and some convincing, *Fithic Rolen* agreed to take everyone in as captives to try and convince the elders of the *Tala-Raksa Clan* to let them help.
* Arriving at the city, *the party* was led into some sort of meeting building while getting confused looks from the citizenry all along the path.
* They were watched over there for a while, awaiting their meeting.

### Explore The City

* Eventually, one of the elders, a firbolg man named *Lucan Shelocal*, joined to greet them.
  * He was ignoring *Colm Rolen* and brushing off offers of help, trying to treat *the party* as guests.
  * Eventually *Elma Moongaze*, another elder, joined as well, telling *Lucan Shelocal* to stop his pandering and warning him he's out of line for what *the clan* expects.
  * Not wanting to make any decisions without all three elders present, the two departed briefly to retrieve *Heian Ollesh*, and start talks in earnest.
  * The elders explained the situation and creatures, eventually noting the source is from a rift on the northern shore of *The Beast's Basin*, a tear in space that leads to the Shadowfell.
  * *The party* once again offered assistance, and they agreed, temporarily lifting *Colm Rolen*'s exile as if he was simply one of them.
  * *B. B.* contacted *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* via Sending to check in, and he was still making his way across the basin at this point.
  * It would take some time to prepare for the ritual, so *the party* was given escorted access to the city to rest up for the day.
* *The party* decided a drink was the best option, and headed for a local meadery with *Colm Rolen* and *Fithic Rolen*.
* Along the way, *Ergan Ilukar* begins talking about how his sword wants him to burn the forest, which he attempts.
  * He is quickly stopped by *Alenia Eldaloth* via a Tidal Wave.
  * Luckily, everyone who saw thought it was some sort of performance.
  * Very much a what-the-fuck moment, with arguments about whether a talking sword is acceptable following.
  * Eventually, not happy about his home being at risk, *Colm Rolen* threatened *Ergan Ilukar* before moving on to continue to the meadery.
* Sitting to get a drink, *the party* discussed the various people they had met.
  * *Heian Ollesh* is very jaded to outsiders after losing his parents in the last incursion from *Machairi* a couple centuries ago.
  * *Elma Moongaze* has had the most direct exposure to outsiders.
  * *Colm Rolen* and *Fithic Rolen*'s parents died a long while ago.
    * Their mother died giving birth to *Fithic Rolen*.
    * Their father, also a defender of the city, died fighting a create of the forest.
  * *Colm Rolen* has only recently begun to embrace his powers a bit, previously shunning them like the rest of his people.

### On The Move

* A guard entered hurried, and whispered to *Fithic Rolen*.
* *Fithic Rolen* then explained that they had to quickly return to the meeting space, as there was an emergency.
* Moving there quickly, *the party* learned there was a large incursion of these rift creatures headed toward the city.
* Still committed to helping, *the party* offered their assistance in fending them off.
