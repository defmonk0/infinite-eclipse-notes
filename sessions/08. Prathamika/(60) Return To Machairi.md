### *Armadyl* In The Night

* As festivities were winding down and everyone went to sleep, *Armadyl* snuck away into the woods to perform a few tasks.
  * First, he used the Sending Stone to message *The Kin*.
    * "We need to talk. We have information for each other that could be mutually beneficial. You know I'm good for it. Don't delay. Details tomorrow."
    * Intrigued, *Niefendil* agreed to meet.
  * After that, *Armadyl* also cast Divination, asking "Should I work with *The Kin*?"
    * "Manipulation is an artform, and that one is well-versed."
  * Frustrated with the continued vague answers, *Armadyl* used a Guiding Bolt to kill a nearby rabbit while lashing out.
    * A bit disgusted with the result, he steels himself to it before returning to the tent and going to bed.

### Departure

* In the morning, *the party* went to get breakfast.
  * In general, the soldiers within the area were much more friendly after *the party*'s involvement.
* While eating, *the party* discussed next plans, concluding on at least stopping in *Machairi* and *Ranafyll* on their way to wherever they go next.
* During breakfast, *Ereth Sparkheart* met up with *the party* and explained that they should head to the meeting space to speak with the elders.
  * Arriving there, the elders expressed their gratitude and offered what they could in rewards:
    * An offer of assistance in return, should *the party* ever need it.
    * A standing welcome of *the party* into *Prathamika*, allowing them to come and go as they please.
    * Continued use of *Fern Frond Apothecary* with the 50% discount previously offered.
    * *Colm Rolen* is now considered part of *Infinite Eclipse* in official capacities, meaning the same status is offered to him.
  * *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* confirmed with the other druids whether the rift they closed seemed natural from what they had seen, and they said nothing seemed out of place to signal otherwise.
  * *Armadyl* pulled *Ereth Sparkheart* aside to give him information on what he saw on the other side of the rift, in The Shadowfell.
    * Expressed that if anything suspicious involving the planes happens, that *Ereth Sparkheart* should contact him, and keep it between the two of them.
* Completing their talks and confirming with *Colm Rolen* that he was heading back to *Machairi*, *the party* and he head out together to return to the city.

### The State Of Things

* On the road, *the party* filled *Colm Rolen* in on what was happening with *Zimi* and *The Ruby Lash*, and everything that happened as a result of that.
* *B. B.* cast Sending to check in on *Zimi*.
  * Responded that everything was fine and that she was currently in *Ranafyll* with the child.
* *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* asked *Colm Rolen* about his warlock powers, and possible relations to how *Ergan Ilukar*'s recent powers work.
  * *Colm Rolen* warns *Ergan Ilukar* to be wary of whatever being is offering these powers, but to use them as necessary.
* *Armadyl* discretely used the Sending Stone to message *Niefendil* once again.
  * "This method too inefficient. Meet at same cafe in *Machairi*, this evening. Let's keep things civil. Heading there now. Tell me how to recognize you."
  * A response came agreeing to meet, noting that he should be able to recognize the form without issue.
  * A second message comes asking if he's coming alone, to which *Armadyl* also agrees.
* *B. B.* uses Sending again to check in on *Prince Grund Caebrek*, who responds that things are fine and everything has been going smoothly.
* Arriving at the plateau which contains the city, *the party* was redirected from the nearest entrance to a singular specific one that is open.
  * *Armadyl* asks if *the prince* has come to a succession decision, to which the guard offers a suspicious "Yes, and he's doing a great job!".
    * Using detect thoughts, he learned that the guard was scared and bad things have been happening to dissidents.
    * Also saw visions of heads on pikes, recognizing some of them as former advisors to *the prince*.
  * At the other entrance, additional checks involving magic to search for illusions or shapechangers are implemented.
    * *The party* is let in with little issue after testing some things with how the magic item and process works via *Rivian*'s use of Disguise Self.
* *Colm Rolen* quickly splits from *the party* to return to *The Stone Pit* to start work on retrieving his Champion's Seat.

### *Ribble* & *Niefendil*

* *The party* head to *the scriptorium* while *Armadyl* flies directly to *Balazar Lasa*'s house, looking for *Ribble Silverthread* and *Balazar Lasa*.
  * *The party* finds *Taklinn* at the front desk, while the heavy guard presence still exists on *the scriptorium* grounds.
    * *Taklinn* informs *the party* that things have kinda gone back to normal other than the guard presence.
    * He noted that *Ribble Silverthread* has not been in, and it's been a few days since *Balazar Lasa* had been by to take off for a while.
  * Meanwhile, *Armadyl* arrives at *Balazar Lasa*'s house to find a trap on the front door.
    * Seeing him peeking out from the second floor, *Armadyl* flies up to speak with him.
    * *Balazar Lasa* hasn't been by in a few days, and *Ribble Silverthread* is running out of food.
    * Unsure of what the spell on the door is, he hasn't gone out himself, so *Armadyl* says he'll go get *Ribble Silverthread* a meal.
* *Armadyl* flies off to the cafe to meet with *Niefendil*, and shortly after his departure, the rest of *the party* arrives as *Balazar Lasa*'s house.
  * *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell*, not seeing the trap on the door, activates the trap and instantly is unconscious, having been put to sleep.
    * *Ribble Silverthread* returns to the door to realize what happens, confirms *the party*'s identity, and then lets them all in now that the door is no longer trapped.
  * Meanwhile, at the cafe, *Armadyl* meets up with *Niefendil* in the form of the Elvish woman used the last time they met here, detect thoughts prepped ahead of time.
    * *Armadyl* informs *Niefendil* that *Mharu* is alive, and that he had spoken with him.
    * *Niefendil* inquires as to why *Mharu* seems to have taken a liking to *Armadyl*.
      * *Armadyl* doesn't really know, which is part of why he has met with him.
    * *Armadyl* notes that he doesn't want the rest of *the party* to know of their meeting.
    * Through a bit of insight, *Niefendil* notes that he assumes *Armadyl* has received some sort of boon from *Mharu*, and asks what his goal is with the relationship to the god.
      * *Armadyl* replied that he seeks understanding, to which *Niefendil* notes might be like *Uklu* then.
    * *Niefendil* and *Armadyl* agree to keep each other informed while hunting down this new lead, and *Niefendil* notes this new relationship will require a planned surprise be called off.
    * *Armadyl* asks what *Niefendil* wants with the gods personally, and through a high persuasion roll, *Niefendil* is open to responding:
      * "I want to take their place. They've had their time."
  * *Armadyl* prepares to leave, and bumps into *Uklu*, who has been invisible and unnoticed behind him, just in case.
  * At the last second, *Armadyl* remembers to head into the cafe and get a to-go meal for *Ribble Silverthread*, and returns to *Balazar Lasa*'s house to meet back up with everyone else.
  * Conversations with *Ribble Silverthread* continue for the evening while he eats, including that *Balazar Lasa* has been searching for *The Kin* in *Teorainn*, and that he should be back sometime the following day.
    * Eventually, everyone winds down for a nights rest and watches are taken.
    * During his watch, *Armadyl* watches from the roof of the building and uses Divination once again, this time asking "Do *The Kin* move against me or my friends?"
      * The response comes: "They can not use you if you are dead. Also, the rabbit was real cute."

# *368-1-5*

* Completing the watches and coming to the break of dawn, *Balazar Lasa* returns and bamfs into the entryway, avoiding the locked door, and, a bit confused, finds *the party* asleep in his living room.
