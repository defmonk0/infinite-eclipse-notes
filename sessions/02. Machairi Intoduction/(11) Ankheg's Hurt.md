### The Battle Begins

* The battle with the four Ankhegs begins.
* It seemingly goes alright until *Ergan Ilukar* becomes surrounded and grapped.
* After a few attacks, he goes unconscious.
* As the Ankhegs start to drop, *the party* manages to keep *Ergan Ilukar* stable.
* *Armadyl* also goes down while helping protect him.
* Eventually, the two are brought back up by *Alenia Eldaloth*'s Healing Spirit.
* The last of them are brought down.
* *The party* is bruised or drained, but everyone survived.

### Let's Not Be Here Anymore

* *The party* wanted to go outside to rest.
* *Florian* and *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* started to argue about what to do next, and *Alenia Eldaloth* finally got fed up and yelled at them to knock it off, heading out for camp.
* *The party* followed.
* *Ergan Ilukar* cured the diseases of *Sennin*, *Samantha Carter*, and *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell*.
* Pondering why the Ankhegs are here, who was here previously, whether the slaves trade could have contributed to the pile of skeletons, and what it could all mean, *Infinite Eclipse* gets a full night's rest.

### Let's Try This Again

* Returning to the interior of the crypt, they try and poke the hive again.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* wildshapes into a panther to prepare for the battle.
  * No response from additional Ankhegs.
* *The party* moves on via the previously found library.
* In the hall just past the library, a book written in Celestial was found.
  * Mostly faded or covered in ash, but some information is still readable.
  * Mentions three names a few times: *Aon*, *Dhama*, and *Trit*.
  * Another excerpt about the trio talks of their disappearance, and choice to remain detached from the world.
  * Elsewhere, it speaks of the deaths of gods, even though they are known to still interact with the world.
* Entered a room with pillars and gems in an alter.
  * The alter is missing 2 of 3 gems.
  * One of the pillars has collapsed.
  * An almost braille-like pattern is imprinted above the slots for the gems.
  * *The party* mostly ignored this puzzle and moved on.
* Continuing into the hall adjacent to the pillar room, *the party* planned on heading down the farther side.
