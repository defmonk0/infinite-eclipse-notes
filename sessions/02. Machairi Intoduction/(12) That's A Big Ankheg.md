### Panthers Can't Find Traps

* Continued down the hall *the party* was previously planning to go down.
* *Alenia Eldaloth*, searching for traps, didn't see one.
  * Summoned some shadowy apparitions.
  * A short stint of combat ensued.
  * The shadows disappeared after a round, ending combat.
* *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell*, *Ergan Ilukar*, and *Alenia Eldaloth* were blinded by the shadows.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* reverted wildshape to rid the blindness.
* *The party* returned to the pillar room since they didn't want to continue while blind.

### Finally Doing My Damn Puzzle

* Figured out the puzzle, breaking the pillars to receive the orbs.
* Opened the door, with a few winding halls behind it.
* At the end of one hall was a large iron key, which *the party* took.
* The other hall ended in a chest full of moon glass.
  * Trapped, but *Florian* took the brunt of it after having the rest of *the party* step far enough back.
  * *Ergan Ilukar* took a bunch of the glass.
* Back to the shadows trap, through the pillar room, continuing on.
* Reach a large door accessible with the large key they found.

### This Is Definitely A Combat Arena

* Behind the door was a large dining hall.
* Filled with misc stuff, in which *Sennin* found a small, decorated, silver key.
* Some minor prep was done in response to hearing approaching burrowing.
* Three Ankhegs started up the fight, with a fourth larger, darkened, Ankheg dripping with black ichor joined the fray.
* The fight somehow went easier than last time.
* *Armadyl* and *Sennin* investigated the black Ankheg.
  * Determined it was tainted by Abyssal influence, similar to *Gilian Edmur*.
* *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* gathered a new trophy head.
* A keg of wine was found in the back, and glasses were shared among a few members of *the party* in celebration.
* It's around 3PM currently.
