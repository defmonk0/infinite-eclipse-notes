### Camping Is Fun

* Set up camp, with a fire and ate some dinner.
* Took watches.
  * While asleep, *Armadyl* had a dream.
    * Was at a familiar waterfall. 
    * After relaxing under it, he was as a temple of some kind. 
    * Most of *Infinite Eclipse* was outside, but *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* and *Ergan Ilukar* were inside. 
    * A cloak depicting a shield and hammer, an old emblem for *Birkoziik, The Steadfast*, was on display. 
    * Upon reaching out for it, the dream ended.
  * During *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* and *Alenia Eldaloth*'s watch, *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* asked about the stabbing situation between *Florian* and *Sennin*. 
    * *Armadyl* woke up from his dream mid-conversation to also be able to catch this.

### Simple Travel

* *Infinite Eclipse* continues towards *Machairi*.
* *Armadyl* asked if anyone recognized the symbol.
  * Several people did, and then the three followers of *Birkoziik, The Steadfast* learned of eachother's faiths.
  * *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell*'s home still uses that symbol, being out in the boonies and not having the latest updates.
  * Also was shared that both *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* and *Armadyl* are from *The Fuar Range*.
  * *Sennin* asks about people's familiarity of *Lubra Forest*, with the attention of going back some day.
* Continued onward, eventually seeing the southern tip of the *Aonru Mountains* and the river in the distance.

### A New Friend (?)

* Upon approaching the bridge and ending travel for the day, another camper was there, *Balazar Lasa*.
* Enjoyed dinner together, conversing about what they have done, and are up to.
  * Learn of Tieflings, since no one was familiar.
  * He works for the *Machairi Grand Scriptorium & Library*, and is on a delivery.
    * A soul gem to a wealthy buyer in *Ranafyll*.
    * Asked about the shards of the sphere from *Tick Tock Clock Stock*'s basement, learning they're not the same, but that it was once tethered to the Abyssal Plane.
  * *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* learned he has slain a young dragon, and began to practically worship him.
  * The dragon skull is supposedly mounted on *Meriele Iranapha*'s wall.
  * Shared that they were bounty hunting beasts and headed to *Machairi*.
* *Florian* and *Sennin* gave new fake names, avoiding trusting *Balazar Lasa*.
* A family of giant boars snuck up on the group from *The Great Plains Of Raavasa*, and attacked.
  * A longer battle, with some closer calls for *Armadyl* and *Florian*.
  * *Armadyl* was saved by *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* who redirected a OHKO for him.
  * *Florian* was saved by *Alenia Eldaloth* via healing during the fight after he went unconscious.
  * *Balazar Lasa* showed off some of his robust skill set.
* *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* replaced his trophy skull with a giant boar head.
* Relaxing resumed for a short bit, before everyone headed to bed.
