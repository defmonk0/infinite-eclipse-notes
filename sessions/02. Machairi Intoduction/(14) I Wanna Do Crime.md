### That Was A Little Illegal

* Still making haste away from *Thistle Do Nicely* after charming the shop-keep.
* Decided to go to the *Marthaag Royal Grounds* to see the *Hall of Heroes*, an attraction in *Zadanthjaal Helgot* open to the public.
* Saw the glowing lake with mothfish inside, the river cavern running out of the city, the warfs and ships.
* Eventually told *Athjar Jaum Bastion* is closed to the public, but what they were looking for was across the way in *Zadanthjaal Helgot*.
* Go in and see the hall.
  * Learn of a hero, *Kafra Mensa*, who helped subjugate *Varadi, The Crimson Inferno* during the *Scorched War*.
  * Also learned of a woman in blue armor from the age of the *Pantheistic War*, discovered during an excavation of ruins from that era.
* Came to a realization that the seven gems on the medallion of *The Kin* likely each corresponded to one of the seven gods.
* On the way out, *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* asked about craftsman.
  * Need to be in the army to get access to military-grade stuff.
  * There is also *Vanchu's Anvil* in town, which contains quality gear.
* Asked about the tunnel, and learned it continues underground all the way to the ocean to the west, where a small ship-repair and restock settlement exists.
  * Too small to be noteworthy or on any maps.

### Exploring The Rougher Districts

* Traveled to *Mothfish Warf*.
* Asked around the various sailors about the *Oighir Sea*, and if anyone is known to travel that far north.
  * It's possible, but rare to see icebreaker ships.
  * It's dangerous and stupid to take other types of ships that far north.
* *Florian* asked about chartering ships.
  * Possible both via the dock-master, and under the table if you are looking for something less official.
* Traveled a bit more to find the 'Adventurer's Bar' that *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* had been asking about previously.
  * Eventually led to *The Water & Tale Bar*.
* *Samantha Carter*'s ridiculous passive perception made it easy to hear cheering from beneath the bar.
  * After *Florian* used thieves cant to ask about it, *Nagre* gave in pretty easy to tell them about it.
  * Between already hearing it and the confirmation that they were likely a bit shady themselves, *Nagre* was no longer concerned about getting caught.

### *The Stone Pit*

* Learned there's an underground (literally) fighting club under the bar named *The Stone Pit*.
  * To get entry, *Nagre* wanted a quick job from *Infinite Eclipse* to prove none of them are going to snitch.
    * Needed to get some payment from a wretch in *Grimm Hill*.
    * Promptly did exactly that, with some creative threatening from *Florian*, *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell*, and a panther-transformed *Alenia Eldaloth*.
    * Didn't get the whole value, but returned with it to turn in the spoils; *Florian* gave her gold instead of the necklace and ring acquired.
* Learned about the rules and set up fights the following night for:
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* as 'Alenia'
  * *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* as 'Mytejager'
  * *Ergan Ilukar* as 'Ergan'
  * *Sennin* as 'Gertjan'
* Went downstairs to watch the final fight for the current night.
  * Saw a younger blond woman, *Zimi*, win a fight with a Lizardfolk named *Gar*.
  * She then had a small spat with the current pit champion, *Colm Rolen*, a large Firbolg who had been watching the fights.
  * *Florian* decided to hit on her.
    * Had company at the bar for the night, but did not have the opportunity to take her home.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* crossed crime and watching a bar fight off of her bucket list, after confirmation from *the party* that tonight counted.

### Retire For The Evening

* *The party* returned to *The Beaver & Mouse Inn* for the evening.
  * On the way, they stopped to check in on *Chestnut*.
* *Sennin* received a message from *Balazar Lasa* during the walk.
  * He asked about whether they'd be in *Machairi* in about a week.
  * Said he may need their assistance with something.
  * *The party* confirmed as much and agreed they would be there.
* At the Inn, *the party* discussed what message to send via sending stone to *The Kin*.
  * Decided on: "We are hunters. Temple was infested with ankhegs. We cleaned it out."
  * Got a response: "Ankhegs, huh? Sizeable adversaries. Interesting indeed. Maybe we should meet sometime..."
* *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* attempted to steal *Alenia Eldaloth*'s bucket list.
  * Did not go well, was immediately caught. Wouldn't have been able to read it anyway.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* shared some of it anyone, reading some of it off to *the party*.
* Afterward, *the party* went to sleep for the evening.

# *367-6-3*

### The Following Morning

* First thing on the agenda in the morning was to move *Chestnut* from the underground stables to the pig farm above ground.
* As they were re-entering, *the party* heard a town crier giving news.
  * "Murder in the streets! An attack in *Ranafyll*. Three dead, killer on the loose! Reward for any information leading to their capture! Cloaked wizard slaughters three in *Ranafyll*! A fireball from one with gray skin!"
  * *The party* immediately thought of *Balazar Lasa*, wondering what he really contacted them for the preceding evening.
* The session ended pondering that moment.
