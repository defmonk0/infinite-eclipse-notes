### Balazar! Again.

* Left *The Beaver & Mouse Inn* to head to the *Machairi Grand Scriptorium & Library* to see *Balazar Lasa*.
* Informed him of everything that had happened.
* Tried to give him the head to question, but instead he offered to take them to interrogate it themselves.
* Teleported to *Meriele Iranapha*'s tower, where she cast Speak With Dead for *the party*.
* *Sennin* disguised himself as a dwarf and began asking questions:
  * *Amert Godwy* was the contractor to return *Sennin*.
  * Did not know *Amert Godwy* to be directly associated with *Black Buck*.
  * *The Ruby Lash* has been hired by *Black Buck* in the past, but not necessarily always connected.
  * *Morwenna Dusange* is the rumored head of *Black Buck*.
  * Last communication *Damiro Campos* had with *Black Buck* was with a Drow man in a small tavern in *Ranafyll*.
* Wrapping up their questioning and quick to get out of *Meriele Iranapha*'s hair, *Balazar Lasa* teleported everyone back to *Ranafyll* before leaving for *Machairi* himself.

### To *Ranafyll*! Again.

* *The party* decided to putz around, waiting for evening to work on the *Amert Godwy* problem.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* attempted to make healing potions.
  * *Armadyl* scoped out the crypt from before and *Amert Godwy*'s mansion from the air.
    * He also noted a holiday was ongoing in passing.
  * *Samantha Carter* picked up the armor she had commissioned.
* *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* suggested they pretend they were returning *Sennin* as a way in to *Amert Godwy*'s house.
* Around sundown, they did exactly that, being allowed into the dining hall by *Jemir 'Gem' Kenafin*.
* *Florian* sneakily poked around a bit, but didn't want to get into anything before their current plan was put into action.
* *Amert Godwy* eventually returned home, meeting the group in the dining hall.
* He recognized *Sennin*, but was skeptical of *the party* since no one but *The Ruby Lash* should have a contract for him at the moment.
* Dismissing them and telling them to leave *Sennin* behind, tensions were high and eventually a fight broke out.
* In the end, *Amert Godwy* quickly fell after a clutch Counterspell by *Sennin*.
* His body dead on the floor, *Jemir 'Gem' Kenafin* began to come down the stairs to see what the commotion was, and witnessed the scene.
