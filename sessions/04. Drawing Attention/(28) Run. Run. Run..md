* The two approaching figures are revealed as they got closer.
  * A *young drow man* who is familiar to *Alenia Eldaloth* and *Florian*.
  * A drow woman, practically in rags and with her hands chained in front of her.
* When he opened the door, he quickly noticed something was up and yelled in asking who was there.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* cast plant growth out the door to make escape difficult.
* *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell*, *Ergan Ilukar*, and *Florian* started to make a break for him, beginning the encounter.
* The *young drow man* used what seemed to be a magic tattoo and teleported himself and the woman deeper into the room.
* The woman took a potion which transformed her into a [Draegloth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/draegloth).
* The man rose a bunch of undead from around the crypt, and then disappeared.
* A stressful battle ensued against the undead and Draegloth, but *the party* emerged victorious without casualty.
  * During the fight, *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* learned his ring was cursed, and has a chance of knocking him unconscious whenever he uses it.

### Leave? Leave.

* After the fight, *the party* reconvened on a plan.
* Eventually, they decided to run away and head to *Machairi* where they can regroup and rearm.

* Made a fast pace across the *The Great Plains Of Raavasa* through the night, eventually coming to rest at the base of the *Aonru Mountains* around daybreak.
* Took a long rest (9 hours to preemptively heal in case something happened during the evening) with watches, though nothing of note was noticed.
* After waking back up, *the party* discussed their plans approaching the bridge, an obvious bottleneck point and possible trap.
