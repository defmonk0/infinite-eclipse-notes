### Battling The Elements

* Immediately set upon by the fire creatures, *the party* began to engage.
  * The creatures flew through the spaces of most of *the party*, lighting everyone on fire.
  * Trading blows and burning for a bit, *Armadyl* eventually managed to banish two of the three creatures.
  * While *Armadyl* moved out of the fray to focus on concentration, the rest of *the party* made quick work of the remaining elemental.
  * Eventually, *Alenia Eldaloth*'s Fire Shield killed the creature with retaliatory damage.
* After the battle concludes, *Sennin* realized that *Moonbeam* had returned to their home plane by force sometime during the fight.

### A Much Needed Rest

* Deciding to rest here for the evening, *Alenia Eldaloth* used Wall of Stone to block off the southern side of the crevasse in case anything else was traveling it.
* *Sennin* took the hour to re-summon *Moonbeam*, and then proceeded to set up Tiny Hut to provide shelter for *the party*.
  * *Moonbeam* had been searching the ground in the requested direction, and didn't notice something flying ahead of him until it was too late.
  * The flying figure ahead of him was only noticed as an arrow coming from it struck *Moonbeam* returning them to their home plane.
* Meanwhile, *Alenia Eldaloth* sent *Tempris* to scout the path ahead for a while.
  * She eventually also sustained enough damage to be cast off the material plane, and so *Alenia Eldaloth* quickly re-summoned her as well.
  * Something had poisoned her, but didn't do any damage.
  * Eventually, something else larger than *the party*, hit her, and that is what ended her scouting session.
* Settling in to rest for the evening, *Armadyl* cast Commune to contact *Birkoziik*.
  * "Am I doing the right thing in relation to *The Kin*?"
    * "Unclear."
  * "Do you know what *Niefendil* is planning?"
    * "No."
  * "Do you know of *Aon*, *Dhama*, and *Trit*?"
    * "Yes."

### The Magma Fields

* Continuing the following morning, the crevasse slowly rose and widened, opening to fields of magma rivers of various sizes, now closer to the main mountain then the falling smog encompasses. 
* *The party* noted a series of strange rock-encrusted flower-like plants situated in the lava flows.
  * They intermittently split and open to reveal a vibrant red and orange flower that quickly makes a puff of pollen that flies away from the rising hot air before closing back up.
  * *Sennin* identifies them as *Fire Blooms*, a plant that lives in places like this.
    * The pollen is poisonous, and the rocky plant explodes if it detects anything else getting too close.
* Moving on, *the party* eventually comes to a wider magma river that would take significant time to go around.
  * Deciding to simple cross it, *Mytejager* jumps while the rest of *the party* crosses a bridge made by *Alenia Eldaloth*'s Wall of Stone.
  * Everyone safely across, *Alenia Eldaloth* stops concentrating on the spell, collapsing the bridge behind them to not leave it for anyone else.

### Ghoulish Guardians

* Beyond the river, a large cavern opening can be seen beyond some large stone outcroppings.
* Additionally, two very large statues are seen, and *Tempris* confirms those are what hit her before.
* Approaching, *Armadyl* hears a voice in his head telling him to leave.
  * While most of *the party* proceeds cautiously, *B. B.* is excited about the cavern being the one from her vision and runs in.
  * Ignoring the voices in her head warning her to turn back as well, *B. B.* is confronted by the two massive statues as they start moving, prepared to block her way.
* Having ignored their warnings, these guardians begin to engage *the party*.
  * *Armadyl* runs bless as a safe bet.
  * *Sennin* uses Dimension Door to move himself and *Alenia Eldaloth* into the cave opening and past the guardians, prompting everyone else to get the idea and take that as the plan.
  * One of the statues is eventually broken by *the party*'s attacks, and a terrifying spectral being is left in its place.
  * Eventually, *Armadyl* takes one last careful look at the path behind *the party* to notice many paths can lead here.
    * Additionally, the faintest sounds of screeching and clanging of battle can be heard in the distance.
  * Agreeing it's best to try and move on quickly, *Armadyl* attempts to fly into the cave but slams into an invisible wall at full speed, just in front of *Alenia Eldaloth* and *Sennin*.
  * Realizing the wall is going to impede *the party*'s progress without finishing off the guardians, *the party* works on specifically teleporting everyone through in some way to leave the second guardian behind for whoever is coming behind them.
* With a final Fiery Teleport from *Tempris* and a Vortex Warp from *Samantha Carter*, *the party* was all safely behind the wall.
  * Watching large rocks being hurled at and breaking on the entrance, *Alenia Eldaloth* used one final Wall of Stone to additionally close off and hide the entrance.
