### Finishing The Trip To *Machairi*

* In the morning, everyone awoke to *Balazar Lasa* making breakfast.
* *Armadyl* asked if *Balazar Lasa* knew anything about *Black Buck*.
  * Nothing particular other than of their existence.
  * Military and *Machairi Grand Scriptorium & Library* have basic information.
* *Balazar Lasa* gave *Sennin* his old spell book after explicitly using his real name.
* Said goodbye, and started back on the road.
* Came across the remnants of one of the Ankheg attacks.
* *Florian* and *Beaks* checked it out, but little was found other than some tracks leading west.

### Arriving In *Machairi*

* Climbed up the plateau the sits sits upon.
* Asked at the gates where they could find information on the job they were looking for.
  * Directed them to a guardhouse, *Athjar Jaum Bastion*, or most taverns.
* Entered what was thought to be a gazebo, which turned out to be an elevator descending into the mountain.
* The city beneath is vast, so *the party* asked directions.
* Directed to *The Beaver & Mouse Inn* for a nicer place to stay, without being super expensive.
* *Infinite Eclipse* asked the barkeep several questions.
  * Asked about the job.
    * Got the notice out of a folder.
  * Political goings-on.
    * Nothing of note within *Machairi*.
  * About the *Machairi Grand Scriptorium & Library*.
    * Nothing *the party* didn't already know other than directions to its location.
  * A hunter's guild or something similar.
    * A rougher bar on the south side commonly houses adventurers who may act as something like that.
    * The *Athjar Jaum Bastion* has a hall of honored heroes and houses their stories as another option.
* *Sennin* copied some of the new spells.
* *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* revealed the contract to clear out the Ankheg nest in *Crypt of Kinzaas' Folly*.
  * 3,000 GP on confirmation of completion.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* gave some basic information about *Kinzaas, The Tormented*.

### But I Don't See Any Books

* Went to *Machairi Grand Scriptorium & Library*.
* *Sennin* asked for information about his amulet.
* Couldn't get approval on super-short notice to research Ankegs for the battle, but a specialist on-hand was offered for basic questioning after showing the job notice.
* While waiting to see him, *Armadyl* filled out a request form to research *Birkoziik, The Steadfast*.
* Met *Ribble Silverthread*, who answered questions for *Infinite Eclipse*.
  * Bunch of info on Ankhegs.
  * Some basic information on Merrows.
  * *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* questioned about *The Beast's Basin*.
    * Disappointed to learn the name is reflective of the shape, not any particular monster.
  * Learned of *Thistle Do Nicely*.
* *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* came up with a plan to draw out the Ankhegs, and ran this by *the party* after returning to the Inn.
* Agreed on the plan and went to bed.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* opened *Gildore's Present*, revealed to be a children's picture book recounting his life in *Aethia*.

### Those Poor Pigs

* Left *Chestnut* behind for his safety.
* Went topside and started heading southwest.
* Bought some pigs at a farm on the outskirts after descending the plateau.
* Eventually found a large temple, thought to be the *Crypt of Kinzaas' Folly*.
* The pigs were used as bait, but promptly lost after getting a few hits in on a couple of Ankhegs.
* With little options left, *the party* checked out the entrance and eventually made their way inside.
