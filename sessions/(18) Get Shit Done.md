* *Alenia Eldaloth*
  * Bought a diamond (300gp).
  * Sold *Chestnut* to the pig farmer, since he wouldn't have wanted to be on a boat.
  * Learned basics of carpentry in town in return for helping.
    * Can make basic things, but it won't be pretty.
* *Armadyl*
  * Looked for enchanting shops.
    * Some retailers have items, and military has items, but specific stuff would need to be commissioned at the *Machairi Grand Scriptorium & Library*.
  * Decided to explore the *Marthaag Royal Grounds*.
    * Flew high to avoid view.
    * Landed on a lookout tower and tried to enter, but failed and broke the lock.
    * Flew down to find something like a dining hall.
      * *Prince Grund Caebrek*, *his aunt*, other random nobles seated and standing throughout the hall.
      * Decided to use message to talk to the prince, and pretend to be his conscience.
      * Learned a bunch about the succession.
        * Asked about which candidates he trusts and whatnot.
        * Aunt is his default choice, since she raised him.
        * She had been acting weird for the last few months and disappears sometimes without him knowing where.
      * Made some progress, but the kid eventually became skeptical.
      * Flew back away after the kid seemingly begins talking to his Aunt about the voice in his head.
  * Then researched the other main front-running candidates for the succession choice:
    * *Machairi Ruling Lineage > Possible Stand-In's For Young Prince Grund Caebrek*
* *Ergan Ilukar*
  * Worked for the local guard for a couple days.

    * Learned she her husband died some time ago.
    * Worked at a small tavern & inn afterward.
    * Eventually started speaking of a man she was starting to have relations with, but everyone who knew her never met him.
      * Thought she might just have been telling tales.
    * Became upset after he hadn't been around in a while.
    * Shortly after did the crime, and then disappeared a couple weeks later.

### Back To The Scriptorium

* *Armadyl* informed the rest of *Infinite Eclipse* about the Aunt, how he thinks it's a power grab from her, and the other main candidates.
* *The party* made its way over to *Machairi Grand Scriptorium & Library* to pick up their requested research.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth*
    * Ivory Oaks
      * No mention in arborist books.
      * Mentioned in an informational book about natural formations with cultural significance.
        * Not much about the oaks other than that they exist and well protected by the wood elves of *Aethia*.
    * Learned about a tree in *Kereskell* named the *Cyfnos Tree*
      * A willow-like tree, bendy and constantly flush with bright yellow leaves; almost like a large bonsai.
      * Used in the *Festival of Silence* as a point of prayer for those who have passed.
        * They decorate the tree with paper lanterns and animal skulls.
      * Located on the edge of a large cliff near the top of the city.
      * *Cyfnos Tree* means 'Twilight Tree' in primordial, and that it was more specifically also known in some texts as "The Progenitor's Twilight".
    * Found a very rough map in a book showing the other continents (detailed maps are hard to come-by due to their strategic importance).
      * *Talamh*
        * North-West of *Semoor*.
        * People immigrate to *Kereskell* and back, usually for merchant, sailing, or trading jobs.
        * Can always charter a ship to head there, though you would be carefully searched before departure to check for anything such as a map.
      * *Unnamed Continent*
        * South-West or *Semoor*.
        * Long, crescent-shaped.
        * A large area of wildlands, wilderness of the harshest degree.
        * Large plains of ice, deserts, and hostile beasts.
        * Completely uninhabitable, and no one has managed an outpost to stake a claim and name the continent yet.
  * *Armadyl*
    * Wanted information on *Black Buck*, but ongoing crimes were restricted.
    * Didn't learn much of anything new, since it's pretty strict.
    * Did learn that they're generally careful to leave most civilians out of their business.
    * Used message to ask *Florian* to request information about the succession and those who are viable candidates.
  * *Sennin*
    * Requested information on the *The Battle For Machairi*, attempting to connect the *Orstrjeth Memorial Plaza* and his emblem, given it was there.
    * Didn't really learn much of help there, but did get some additional information on the war itself.
  * *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell*
    * Wanted information on ports, ships, oceans, etc.
    * Anything on icebreaker expeditions was restricted due to the nature of the research, however the ships themselves and how to contract them was fine.
      * Learned they are mostly independently owned, and commonly run by ex-pirates.
        * The only ones crazy enough to get into that business.
      * Learned they commonly leave off the coast east of *Asvarholm*.
        * Icebreakers are slow, so coming all the way from *Machairi* would be overkill for most expeditions.
        * Too big to use the smaller fishing ports in the other northern cities.
        * Uses small rowboats to make it to or from shore.
    * Looked into hazards in the *Oighir Sea* and others.
      * Obviously, the ice floes are an issue.
      * Heavy storms and bitter cold make it difficult.
      * Many creatures are more hostile due to lack of food.
        * Large sharks
        * Sea hags
        * Giant squids
        * Giant tortoises
        * Legends of:
          * Dragon turtles
          * Kraken
          * Deep sea leviathan
      * Tried to find information specifically on the leviathan
        * No first-hand accounts
        * Stories of them from many deep seas, far from land
        * Used accounts to figure out they are most commonly noted from the *Kyran Ocean*.
* Before leaving, *Florian* requested information at the behest of *Armadyl*
  * General information on the succession.
  * Used the name 'Gregory Lockheed'
  * Approval would probably come quick, since he's not the only one who requested as much
* *The party* returned to *The Beaver & Mouse Inn* to rest for the night.
  * Discussed a plan for where to meet *Balazar Lasa* the next day.
    * Decided best place was *The Water & Tale Bar*.

# *367-6-9*

### Meet The Wizard

* While waiting on his arrival, *Sennin* received a sending spell from *Balazar Lasa* asking where they were to meet up.
  * Sent him to *The Water & Tale Bar* as discussed.
* *Infinite Eclipse* made their way over.
  * *Florian* tailed behind the group just in case, using *Beaks* as a mid-way point to watch from.
* *Balazar Lasa*, disguised as a human, entered and dropped the disguise.
  * Informed *the party* that the killings were him, in self defense.
  * Planned to turn himself in, but had an item he didn't want the guard to get ahold of.
  * His master (*Meriele Iranapha*) wasn't responding due to likely being astral projected at the moment, and *Infinite Eclipse* was the next option he thought of.
  * Wants them to hold on to an artifact until he can get free to re-collect it.
    * Has a plan to prove his innocence using speak with dead and a head of one of the victims.
  * Was a little thrown off, but not deterred, by *the party*'s drug mule job.
  * DO NOT LET THE BOX GET TAKEN.
  * ALSO DON'T FUCKING LOOK AT IT.
  * Also gave the option of dropping it off to *Meriele Iranapha* if she's around and they have the chance.
* After handing over the item, *Balazar Lasa* made his way out of the bar to head toward a guardhouse.
* The session ended.
