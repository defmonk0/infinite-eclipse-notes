### Gathering Rewards

* *The party* woke up and had some breakfast while *Sennin* attempted to decode the paperwork.
  * He was not successful, but could try again another day.
* After breakfast, *the party* made their way to *Hlavar-Jufa Keep*, where *Fallthra Bigoat* and *Agnew Solidsgurd* were in the entrance hall.
  * *Agnew Solidsgurd* received the deed to *the house* to ratify that.
  * *Fallthra Bigoat* lead *the party* downstairs into a meeting room in the dungeons.
    * Unhappy about it, but doing her job, *Fallthra Bigoat* had to inform *the party* that the whole vampire business was being covered up, and they would have to be complacent in that.
    * *The party* noted that *Dayeren Underwood* was the first to suggest the cover-up.
    * Options were to keep them there in the dungeons, or to pay (handsomely) for their silence and let them go.
  * *The party* happily took the money and left, getting their deed again on the way out.

### Making Plans

* On the way home, *Alenia Eldaloth* and *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* returned to the scene of the fight with *Halis* to try and find another sapling.
  * There wasn't one, and instead some dead grass from the infernal ash and brimstone that the devils had dissipated into.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* used plant growth to fix up the area.
* Returning to *the house*, *the party* planned to drop some stuff off and head out to celebrate.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* replanted the sapling from the greenhouse to the front of the property to start a grove lining the road.
  * Most members put a large portion of their platinum reward into the safe so they weren't carrying it around.
* Returning to *The Merry Deck*, *the party* had some drinks to celebrate their success.
  * *B. B.* pulled *Alenia Eldaloth* aside to have a quiet conversation about possibly going to the Feywild.
    * She was dancing around exactly why, but explained the situation at home with *Haedok* having taken the village and killed its inhabitants.
    * *Armadyl* was overhearing the conversation, and eventually used Detect Thoughts to get a mental image of *Haedok*.
    * *Alenia Eldaloth* eventually slid back to rejoin the group, realizing they were being heard anyway, resolving to an understanding that they might do it eventually, but it wasn't feasible now.
* Finishing up their drinks, *the party* split up to take care of errands.
  * *Samantha Carter* went shopping.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* sent an Animal Messenger to her mother to update them, and checked in on the plants in the greenhouse.
  * *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* wrote a letter to *Miles Jerner*, asking to trade back the Ettin head *the party* used to get the continent map, and then got his vampire heads stripped of flesh for presentation.
  * *Sennin* sent a message to *Balazar Lasa* to let him know they were headed back to *Machairi*.
    * *Balazar Lasa* acknowledged their plans, and updated that *Artlaag* left the *Machairi Grand Scriptorium & Library* excited and in a hurry the previous day.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* and *Armadyl* had a conversation about *Sapientia's Lunar Wristlet*.
    * Learned about *Armadyl*'s connection to *Birkoziik*.
    * Talked about *Armadyl* and *Birkoziik*'s conversation about the *Crown of Segnis* being a tool, and worship not being a requirement of its use.
* After everyone returned to *the house* for the evening, *Agnew Solidsgurd* stopped by as requested.
  * Needed a few days to get together *Morwenna Dusange*'s paperwork about the previous members of *The Kin*.
  * Was told to leave it at *the house* with *Berric* and he could forward it as needed.
  * Talked about who would fill the newly missing seat on the *Ranafyll City Council*.
  * *Agnew Solidsgurd* informed *the party* that knowledge of their deeds should be promptly spreading through the *Mistguard*, and will likely be more trusted with access to classified jobs or purchase of military reserves in the future.
    * It was also mentioned that one such job is available about people going missing in the *Lubra Forest*, and could be inquired about with *Fallthra Bigoat*.
* *Agnew Solidsgurd* departed, and eventually *Berric* informed *the party*, concerned, about something glowing on the roof.
  * After a careful approach and a brief investigation, *the party* found there is a teleportation circle on the roof of *the house*.
