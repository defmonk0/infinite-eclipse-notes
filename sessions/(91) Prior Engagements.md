### Last Minute Decisions

* As the evening watch continued, *Armadyl* noticed *Berric* return from his date late in the evening, and then eventually retired to bed himself.

# *368-4-8*

* In the morning, *Mytejager* was a bit exhausted from his drug usage the day before.
* At breakfast, *Alenia Eldaloth* showed off the awakened form of *Sapientia's Lunar Wristlet*.
  * *The party* also inquired about her prompt return, having been a bit surprised, though *Alenia Eldaloth* side-stepped seeing *Armadyl* and *B. B.* in the panic closet via Scrying.
* *The party* then discussed their plans for the day.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* wants to buy diamond dust
    * *The party* simply gathers together enough of their diamond scrap to make the amount she needed, and *Samantha Carter* used her jewelers kit to grind them down.
  * *Teng* and *Terkol Liongaze* need to be returned to *Teorainn*.
  * *B. B.* asks *Sennin* to identify the branch *Alenia Eldaloth* had given to her, and *B. B.* attunes to it after learning what it does.
  * *Armadyl* and *Alenia Eldaloth* talk about the origin story *Armadyl* had seen in his visions, including that *Aon*, *Dhama*, and *Trit* were the natural energies that made the material plane.
  * *The party* discusses what should be done about *Artlaag*, as *Alenia Eldaloth* had seen him alone in the farmhouse outside of *Mastow* when she cast Scrying on him.
    * *Alenia Eldaloth* casts Scrying once again to confirm he was still here and found him asleep in the same spot.
    * *Mytejager* is ready to go, but *the party* waits a short additional time for the diamond dust and attunement to be finished.
    * *Alenia Eldaloth* offers to cast Greater Restoration on *Mytejager*, but he declines.
* Once everyone was ready, final preparations are made and *the party* walks to a nearby tree for *Alenia Eldaloth* to cast Transport Via Plants to take them to the farmstead.

### A Familiar Farmhouse

* Arriving on the scene, *the party* takes a stealthy approach while *Ergan Ilukar* uses his Armor Of Etherealness to move in close.
  * Getting into position while *Artlaag* is preparing his morning tea, he is magically warned of their imminent engagement, and calls out to greet *the party*.
* The battle kicks off, and everyone begins to attack *Artlaag*.
  * *Mytejager* becomes big, and *Armadyl* uses Enlarge to make him even bigger.
  * *Sennin* summons his Draconic Spirit.
  * Various other attacks are made, quickly reducing *Artlaag* to a critical state.
* *Artlaag* pulls a vial from his pocket, crushing it in his hand and swallows it.
  * His body changes, transforming into a giant turtle creature, and the battle continues.
  * *Armadyl* continues searching his mind for the information he learned at *Aon's Maw* to try and figure out how to counter *Eolai's Blood Worms*.
    * Eventually, he realizes that they could be dispelled when in a vulnerable state.
  * *The party* continues to bombard this form and take hits as the fight continues, and the farmhouse is lit aflame.
* Eventually, *Artlaag*'s growth and transformation begins to settle and compress, forming into a dragon-turtle hybrid form that returns to using powerful magic.
  * Eventually, *Artlaag* decides his best move is to try to run while continuing to do considerable damage from a distance.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* attempts to put out some of the fire with Tidal Wave.
  * *Rivian* and *Kulika* are able to keep pace with *Artlaag* as he runs, eventually managing to briefly knock him unconscious.
