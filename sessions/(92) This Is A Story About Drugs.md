### Continuing The Fight

* Quickly getting back up, *Artlaag* knocks *Mytejager* unconscious with an attack.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth*'s Healing Spirit quickly brings him back up though.
* *Sennin* purposely moves into melee with *Artlaag* to provide *Rivian* an optimal attack, and *Kulika* quickly follows.
* *Samantha Carter* uses Vortex Warp to teleport the battle-worn *Mytejager* next to *Artlaag*, allowing him to lay into *Artlaag* and knock him out once again.
  * *Armadyl* shares that he has an idea to stop the worms, and makes his way over while everyone else focuses on keeping *Artlaag* down.
  * *Armadyl* then feels a power well up within him to cast Dispel Magic, something he normally can't do.
    * Using the *Crown of Segnis* to gather the energy needed, he hears a voice reassure him to "End this plague.".
  * As the worms fail to hold the form of *Artlaag*, they begin separate, melt, and evaporate, leaving no body behind.
    * As the process happens, *Ergan Ilukar* casts Ceremony to give him funeral rites to help avoid his return.
    * As he does, he too hears from *Birkoziik*, stating his actions should stop his return.
* As everyone calms and the battle ends, *the party* regroups.
  * *B. B.* takes some time to cast Prayer Of Healing to help bolster everyone back up a bit.
  * *Sennin* begins preparing Teleportation Circle.
  * *The party* loots the magical items left behind in place of *Artlaag*'s melting body.
  * *The party* passes through the Teleportation Circle and into *Albar Ronaro*'s cramped hidden room in *Teorainn*.

### Return To *Teorainn*

* With some minor hiccups, *the party* leaves *Albar Ronaro*'s house as best as they could, and head towards the guardhouse at the north gate.
  * Searching for the individual that *Armadyl* spoke to when borrowing the bodies, *the party* is eventually directed to and finds *2nd Statum Thoman Mich* at the docks.
  * *2nd Statum Thoman Mich* directs *the party* to take the bodies to the funeral director near *Vedelem Temple*, and that they had found them on their travels.
  * *Mytejager* asks if there was any reward for them, and finds their neighborhood had put one together with direction to speak to someone named *Glynren Firegleam*.
  * Arriving to speak with the funeral director, *the party* learns that they are in fact *Glynren Firegleam*, and a bit of a creep.
    * The bodies are returned, and the reward collected.

### Are We The Baddies?

* *Armadyl* wishes to stop in at *Vedelem Temple* to see *Albar Ronaro*, so *the party* makes a quick detour.
  * The doors to *the temple* are found closed, which is unusual.
  * *Mytejager* knocks, and eventually *Nallin Torevir* pokes his head out and quickly ushers *the party* inside and relocks the doors.
  * At the front of the temple, a man is bloodied and tied to a chair aside *Albar Ronaro*.
  * *Nallin Torevir* informs *the party* that the individual, *Crab-Hands James*, is the individual who smuggled the original members of *The Kin* after their warehouse was raided.
    * *Crab-Hands James* apparently didn't know who the individuals were, and was just doing a job.
    * His ship smuggled a half-dozen individuals out of *Ranafyll*, and provided new identities before returning ashore.
      * Most were returned to *The Principality of Marthaag*, but two requested to be taken to *The Dominion of Siresia*.
    * The ship's crew had a flea infestation after, reinforcing *Nallin Torevir*'s theory that the shapeshifter *the party* encountered was a werewolf. 
* The scene not sitting well with several *party* members, they decide to leave *Nallin Torevir* and *Albar Ronaro* to it.
  * On the way out, they can hear the two discussing the use of Modify Memory on *Crab-Hands James*, implanting that the injuries were from a recent voyage instead.

### Can't Leave Well Enough Alone

* *The party* then returned to *The Steedâ€™s Flagon* to get lodging for the evening and discuss the day's events.
  * *Armadyl* shares what he figured out about the destruction of the worms.
  * *The party* reviews and splits the items retrieved from *Artlaag*.
    * Potion Of Healing: *Alenia Eldaloth*
    * Potion Of Vitality: *Mytejager*
    * Money: split among *the party*
    * Vicious Whip: *Armadyl*
    * Whip Of Warning: kept in the Bag Of Holding
    * Spellguard Shield: *Ergan Ilukar* once his current shield curse is lifted
    * Ring Of Protection: *Sennin*
* The party then discusses what to do next.
  * Particular thought is given to what to do about *Nordri Trueanvil*, who is theoretically alive and stuck in lava.
  * *Mytejager* takes out the Sending Stone to message *Niefendil*.
    * "You killed one of ours, we killed one of yours. From now on, you keep it between us." - *Mytejager*
    * "I was just about to contact you all. I assume this inferno was your doing? A shame about the old man." - *Niefendil*
  * *Armadyl* then receives a message directly.
    * "I assume this means you wouldn't like to share what you have learned?" - *Niefendil*
    * "I have my concerns." - *Armadyl*
    * "Very well. I shall find another way then. It's been a pleasure working with you, *Armadyl*. Rest well." - *Niefendil*
    * "I know Mharu spoke to you as a child. I know Uklu means more than you let on. It doesn't have to be like this." - *Armadyl*
  * Finally, another message comes to *Mytejager* from *Niefendil*, to which he repeats and responds aloud.
    * "One for one, is it? A simple logic. I like it. I believe your one is fine now, though. We may need to find another." - *Niefendil*
    * "You struck first. If you didn't want a war, you should never have done that." - *Mytejager*
* At this point, *Alenia Eldaloth* is having a bit of a panic attach and goes to find *The Panic Closet* with *B. B.*, prompting the party to begin going about other business.

### Drugs Continue To Be The Answer

* *Ergan Ilukar* requests *Mytejager* provide him with some drugs, expressing his desire to have a drug-fueled confrontation similar to *Mytejager*.
  * *Mytejager* is skeptical, but eventually provides them to him, requesting he wait a day until *Alenia Eldaloth* has the energy to fix him up after if it goes wrong.
* Ignoring the request, *Ergan Ilukar* takes a dose of *White Flake*, a dose of *Suude*, and a dose of *Devil Weed*.
  * Immediately hit by the adverse effects of the drugs, *Ergan Ilukar* falls unconscious.
  * Falling into a dream-like state, he calls out for a response.
  * Two giant yellow eyes open in the darkness in front of him, *his patron*, heeding *Ergan Ilukar*'s call.
  * *Ergan Ilukar* inquires about the details of his contract, concerned that he agreed to something he was uncomfortable with.
    * *His patron* explains that he requires some tasks be done.
    * Some other followers are doing work preparing for the events to unfold, and will be waiting for *Ergan Ilukar*.
    * When the time is right, *Ergan Ilukar* will provide the fire breath the entity has provided him, and the contract will have been fulfilled.
  * *Ergan Ilukar* then asks *his patron* for his name, to which he is told that he can simply call him "*V*".
  * Finally, *Ergan Ilukar* asks if there is going to be any conflicts between him and his following of *Birkoziik*, and "*V*" informs him there should not be, as he has "little interest in the Gods and their world".
* In a sweat and feeling like garbage, *Ergan Ilukar* comes back to consciousness briefly to find *Sennin* having just walked in to find him.
  * Having come to request access to his sword once again, *Sennin* simply backs away slowly having realized what was going on.
  * *Ergan Ilukar* then promptly passed back out.
