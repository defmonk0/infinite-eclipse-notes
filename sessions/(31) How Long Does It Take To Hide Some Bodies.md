### Everyone Needs To Go Away

* Guards showed up.
  * Starting asking about what was going on since they got a report about a possible altercation here.
  * *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* told them *The Ruby Lash* showed up, started causing problems, and they kicked them out.
  * The guards recognized him from the camp a couple nights ago, and were inclined to believe him.
  * Their leader went in to check in on *Nagre*, but left without too much prodding.
* *Armadyl* noticed an individual (*Ghaundar*) on the roofs across the street, keeping an eye on them and hiding.
  * Informed *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell*.
  * After the guards were clear, *Armadyl* made a break to confront him via flight, catching up to him to begin asking questions.
  * He tried running, using invisibility to his advantage.
  * *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* managed to luckily bump into him on his own way over, and stopped him.
  * The two dragged him inside to interrogate him as well.

### Bag Of Holding: Now For Bodies!

* *Alenia Eldaloth* got the bag of holding from *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell*.
* The plan was to strip the bodies and put them in the bag.
* They could then be taken elsewhere to be disposed of.
* *Florian* took them into a nearby hidden alley and stabbed them to finish the job before covering them up a bit and heading back.
  * Everyone later returned to retrieve the head of *Damiro Campos* and *Alenia Eldaloth* covered the bodies a bit more with Plant Growth.
* Meanwhile, the party began interrogating *Ghaundar*.
  * Learned he was sent to keep an eye on *The Ruby Lash*.
  * Hired by *young drow man* in Ranafyll.
  * *The Ruby Lash* was staying at *The Sharp Web Inn*.
  * Had no plans on how to contact anyone with information again in the future.
  * *Infinite Eclipse* sent him to one of the rooms at *The Beaver & Mouse Inn*, and told him to stay there and see if he is contacted.
* A short rest was had while waiting for the bar to clear out a bit, and all the gear was identified.

# *367-9-3*

* Afterwards, everyone went to interrogate *Nordri Trueanvil*.
  * He was already awake.
  * They ungagged him and began asking questions.
  * *Sennin* and *Armadyl* used detect thoughts to try and get better answers.
  * All the party learned was that *Damiro Campos* was notified of a contract for *Sennin*.
  * It was possible other people could have overheard about the contract, but no one else was directly informed or actively working on it.
  * The party dispatched him as well, and returned his bodies with those of his compatriots. 

### I Said B&B, Not B&E!

* After wrapping up, *Infinite Eclipse* returned to *The Beaver & Mouse Inn* to spend the night.
* *Ghaundar* was there, as instructed, asleep and drunk in one of the beds.
* In the morning, the party invited him to breakfast with them and played good cop this time, warning him against taking spy jobs from shady people in the future.
* Told him to send information he gets via mail to them via *The Beaver & Mouse Inn*, and they would have *Balazar Lasa* check for them later.
* After breakfast, the party was on their way.
