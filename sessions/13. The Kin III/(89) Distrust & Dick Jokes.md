### Escape

* *Armadyl* offered to retrieve the body of *Nordri Trueanvil*, wanting to ensure he's dead and loot the body.
  * *Mytejager* was fixated on the idea that *Armadyl* should be more concerned with taking care of *the party*, rather than *Nordri Trueanvil*, seeing it as a chance to show his priorities.
* *Sennin* began setting up the Teleportation Circle to get out of *Aon's Maw* and return home, putting a timer on everything and telling *Armadyl* he better be quick if he's getting the body.
* *Mytejager* wanted to know what *Armadyl*'s arrangement with *Niefendil* was.
  * *Armadyl* explained that he can go into more detail after they are safe, but the short explanation was that they came to an agreement to keep everyone safe.
  * *Armadyl* also noted that this agreement is the reason why *Nordri Trueanvil* left *Berric* and *The House*.
* *Samantha Carter* noticed what looked to be an additional Fire Elemental poking up out of the lava lake.
  * About the same time, *Sennin* finished his spell and everyone quickly made their way through the Teleportation Circle back to *Ranafyll*.
* On the roof of *The Antumbral Aerie*, the arguments continue but it is suggested *the party* use Zone Of Truth to talk this all out the next day after getting some rest.
  * *B. B.* suggests swapping from *Ergan Ilukar* watch to *Armadyl* watch for the night, and *Mytejager* takes *Ergan Ilukar*'s body to the dining room.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* plucks a feather from *Armadyl* as a contingency if needed, though she noted she wasn't concerned he'd run off.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* then poignantly asked if *Armadyl* thought everything that just happened was worth it, to which he replied that he thought so.
* Everyone then went to find their various vices and rest for the evening throughout *the house*, and *B. B.* finds *Berric* hiding the fact that he had *Selma* over.
  * After poorly sneaking her out, *Mytejager* tells *Berric* he should go after her, and stay gone for a while for his own safety.
  * Noting the state of *the party*, *Berric* declines and stays behind to cook and take care of them as needed.
* Finding *Mytejager*, *Armadyl* offers to revive him right now, but what he does is more detrimental to *Ergan Ilukar*.
  * Raise Dead takes a physical toll on the target, while Revivify does not, and so *Armadyl* thought it more pragmatic to have *Alenia Eldaloth* take care of it in the morning.
* In the middle of the night while the rest of *the party* is asleep, *Alenia Eldaloth* leaves a note and her diamond behind before using Transport Via Plants to return to *Aethia*.

# *368-4-7*

### Home

* In *Aethia*, *Alenia Eldaloth* finds sleep in her room for a while before *Gildore Eldaloth* finds her there, surprised.
  * By this time, *Arwenel Eldaloth* already left for the day to help out at the temple.
* *Alenia Eldaloth*, in a bit of an existential spiral, informs *Gildore Eldaloth* of everything that has been happening.
  * He's sympathetic, but pragmatic, trying to help as he can, and the two eventually settle in to relax for the day.
* A few hours of reading later, *Alenia Eldaloth* receives a Sending from *Meriele Iranapha*, who is sick of *Arahaam*.
  * Quickly deciding she was done keeping lookout, *Meriele Iranapha* used Scrying and Teleportation to quickly appear at *Alenia Eldaloth*'s door.
  * She's picking up wine, and notes that no Tortle ever passed in or out of the city.
    * The strangest thing she DID see were two Kobolds leaving the city this morning.
  * After some more brief updates, her wine delivery arrives, and she promptly uses Teleport to take it and herself home.

### Confrontations

* Back at *The Antumbral Aerie*, *Sennin* finds *Alenia Eldaloth*'s note and wakes *Mytejager* to show him.
  * Unconcerned, he goes back to sleep while *Sennin* begins casting Private Sanctum in the dining room to prepare for their discussion.
* As the rest of *the party* begins filtering in, *Sennin* explains that the spell should provide them full privacy.
* Before heading down to join the group, *Armadyl* uses Sending to let *Ribble Silverthread* know that he may want to lay low again.
  * *Ribble Silverthread* replies that he should be fine, as he's not even in *Machairi* at the moment, but appreciates the warning.
* Once everyone has gathered in the dining room, *B. B.* casts Revivify on *Ergan Ilukar* using the diamond that *Alenia Eldaloth* left behind.
  * *Ergan Ilukar*, coming back to life, hears his sword note that it was glad he was back.
* *Ergan Ilukar* gets caught up on what's been going on, and then *B. B.* casts Zone Of Truth so *the party* can begin sorting everything out.
  * *B. B.* opens with asking *Armadyl* if they're friends, to which he agrees.
  * *Sennin* asks *Armadyl* if he did anything that helped *The Kin* get in to *Aon's Maw*, to which he says no.
  * *Sennin* then asks what the agreement was, and *Armadyl* explains that he was concerned with attacks on *the party* or friends, so he traded information for safety.
    * He also felt that he ended up with more than they did, noting that *Niefendil* told him about the leads in the *Gnarlwood* and *Aon's Maw*.
    * This prompted *Mytejager* to become defensive, having been led by his own visions from *Leighas*.
  * *Ergan Ilukar* asks *Armadyl* to explain any deals he's had with other gods or entities other than *Birkoziik*.
    * *Armadyl* gives a list of his general interactions, including that *Mharu* comes to mess with him as he pleases, and he has spoken with *Isdaima*, but *the party* already knows about those.
    * He also reveals that he thought he saw *Leighas* in *Vedelem Temple*.
  * *Mytejager* then turns the questioning towards *Ergan Ilukar*, taking clever advantage of the situation to ask what deals *Ergan Ilukar* has made with such entities.
    * *Ergan Ilukar* explains that he's not entirely sure, noting he gets powers through his sword, but doesn't know the whole deal, nor who or what is behind it.
    * *Sennin* asks how it happened, and *Ergan Ilukar* explained that after using the sword for a while, it simply started speaking to him and offering him these powers.
  * *Armadyl* alludes to the burnt building in *Caldur*, trying to get *Ergan Ilukar* to acknowledge it, but it legitimately seemed insignificant enough to him that he more or less forgot about it. 
  * The questioning devolves into bickering for a while, as one might expect, but after a time *Sennin* eventually brings things back on track and asks *Armadyl* what he saw from the *Cognition Obelisk* in *Aon's Maw*.
    * *Armadyl* learned a lot and still processing.
    * *Sennin* then presses more specifically, asking what *Niefendil* wants with it.
    * *Armadyl* explains *Niefendil*'s motivations are to use information from the *Obelisks* to eventually become a god himself, reiterating *Niefendil*'s line that he thinks "they've had their time".
  * *Mytejager* then brings up *Armadyl*'s lack of trust in the group with the information he learns, and *Armadyl* retorts that he just doesn't always trust others will see the nuances in things.
  * *Sennin* brings up one last question before *Mytejager* leaves, asking *Armadyl* about his trip through the rift in *Prathamika*.
    * *Armadyl* explains he went through and into the Shadowfell, where he saw some force driving the creatures through the portal.
  * As *the party* begins to disperse and the spell came to an end, *Armadyl* realized that *Berric* sat through that without ever getting to ask his question, and prompts him to do so.
    * *Berric* notes that it feels inappropriate after all of that, but asked if *Armadyl* had ever pooped on anyone while flying.
    * *Armadyl* replied not that the ever knew of, but added a obvious wink.

### Aftermath

* *Armadyl* and *Sennin* join *B. B.* in the garden to partake in *B. B.*'s suggestion of teambuilding exercises.
  * The trio have a small heart-to-heart about everything that's happened, discussing giving *Mytejager* time and uncertainty in what to do about *Alenia Eldaloth*.
* Meanwhile, in *Aethia*, *Alenia Eldaloth* stops in to see *Thamior Caphaxath* to check in on the security situation, and learns that patrols have been running nonstop.
  * About this time, *B. B.* used Sending to contact *Alenia Eldaloth*, upset that she left and asking why.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* explains that someone had to revive *Ergan Ilukar*, and that she knew *B. B.* was capable.
* *B. B.*, seemingly unknowing what giving someone time and space means, then heads upstairs to talk to *Mytejager* who is adding his additional trophies to his trophy rack.
  * *Mytejager* reflects on the trophies, noting he would have never been strong enough to kill all of them before he left home, and thought he was strong enough because of *the party* he was with, but is now unsure if he can continue that.
    * Continuing, *Mytejager* explains that *Birkoziik* gave him a mission to protect them, and he guesses he's going to do that whether he's comfortable or not.
  * Finally, he notes that he wants to add *Niefendil*'s head to this shelf, but is unsure whether *Armadyl* wants that.
    * *Mytejager* asks *B. B.* if she would kill *Niefendil* if given the chance, which she confirms indifferently.
    * *Mytejager* is grateful, noting he thinks he can trust her, and promises to help her with her problem at home as well.
* Not done, *B. B.* continues the rounds by returning to *Armadyl*, who worries about everyone's safety, both *party* and friends, during this all now that the agreement has seemingly fallen apart.
  * *Sennin* notes they have safety in numbers, but *Armadyl* retorts that that's only true if there's also trust, and brings up his own uncertainty about *Ergan Ilukar*, *Rivian*, and *Samantha Carter*.
  * *Sennin* notes that he doesn't necessarily distrust *Ergan Ilukar*, but more specifically the unknown power he uses.

### Retail Therapy

* As everyone goes their own ways to calm down, a lot of *the party* starts hitting up the shops in town.
  * *Armadyl* buys some incense and inquires about a Potion Of Growth, which he is directed to a nearby retired alchemist to acquire.
  * *Sennin* buys some Potions Of Healing.
  * At *Selma*'s shop, *Sennin* puts in an order for a very expensive Sapphire, and *Armadyl* buys some replacement diamonds.
  * Continuing to require more incense, *Armadyl* finds someone at the docks who he is able to buy another large quantity from.
  * *Mytejager* fails to find an apothecary, and eventually resolves to searching for *Agnew Solidsgurd* at *Hlavar-Jufa Keep*, who he learns has been summoned to *Caldur* to help *Prince Grund Caebrek* with something.
* Back in *Aethia*, *Alenia Eldaloth* joins up with *Theren Sylvaranth* to help with a patrol.
  * Lamenting that she left her Scrying focus behind, *Theren Sylvaranth* notes the font of holy water in the temple may be able to work.
* Later in the same day, *B. B.* sends to *Alenia Eldaloth* once again: "Hey! I miss you, please come home! The boys are fighting. Love you bye."
