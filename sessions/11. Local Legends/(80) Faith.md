### Completing A Conversation

* *Alenia Eldaloth* notices *Armadyl* is acting a bit strange after he receives his message.
  * She asks about it, but he states that everything is fine and she doesn't push any further.
  * After *Alenia Eldaloth* moves on to speak with *Teng*, *B. B.* *does* push, and *Armadyl* says he's not thrilled with the outcomes at the temple but still needs time to think it over.
  * While talking to *B. B.*, *Armadyl* is constantly scanning the area, feeling exposed.
    * He notices a rock fall from a pillar, like an invisible individual was there, but doesn't pursue it.
  * *B. B.* expressed concern over her relationship with *Alenia Eldaloth*, which *Armadyl* explains a theory that *Alenia Eldaloth* feels responsible for the group in some ways, leading to her acting more reserved.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* asks *Teng* about *Terkol Liongaze*, which she says doesn't ring a bell.
* *Mytejager* pushes for any other stories *Teng* may have, stating her previous ones led to notable discoveries.
  * She notes that none in particular point out specific weapons or *artifacts*, but agrees that they might act as clues.
  * She points towards *Aon's Maw* as a target, noting its common usage in her legends and that the danger involved has resulted in few expeditions in that direction.

### Back At The Inn

* On the walk back towards *The Steedâ€™s Flagon*, *Alenia Eldaloth* asks *Sennin* to send a message to *Thamior Caphaxath*.
  * 
     > 
     > Remember the sword you gifted to Alenia's dragonborn friend? It is talking to him and telling him to burn things: forests, goblins, us. Thoughts?
  
  * 
     > 
     > That is concerning... Our fighters use bows; spears. It was never taken up. I believe it came from the valley, before the city was built.

* Returning to their rooms, *the party* then regrouped to have a conversation about plans for the next day.
  * *Sennin* separated to get some language studies done.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* writes a letter to *Manfred Iranapha*.
  * *Mytejager* and *Armadyl* debrief about the *Ergan Ilukar* fight, with *Armadyl* expressing disappointment that his defenseless stance did little to bait out whatever is affecting *Ergan Ilukar* via the sword.
    * The two of them also talk about *Armadyl*'s plans to return to the temple that evening, and *Mytejager* offers to join him.
    * *Mytejager* also gives *Armadyl* back the *Crown of Segnis* in preparation for the evening.
  * After finishing individual business, most of *the party* met back up in the tavern to have a drink and talk.
    * *Alenia Eldaloth* had *B. B.* use Sending to check in on *Berric* who replied flustered and distracted.
      * He was fine, but out with someone (*Selma*) at the moment.
    * *B. B.* also introduced *the party* to a drinking game to unwind a bit, and so Flip Cup was introduced to the Material Plane from the Feywild for the first time.

### A Strange Encounter

* Most of *the party* returned to their chambers for bed, but *Armadyl* and *Mytejager* planned to prepare to head out to the temple.
* Returning to his room, *Armadyl* is greeted by a strange situation: *Mytejager* frozen in place, and absolute silence.
  * *Mharu* is present, seemingly having stopped time for a conversation, and explains that he has essentially been fucking with *Armadyl* for the fun of it.
  * He notes that he may have gone too far, possibly referencing the crying woman seen briefly by *Armadyl* as *Leighas*.
  * *Mharu* states *Armadyl* should use his powers to reach out to *Birkoziik* since he was not supposed to do so himself.
  * On the way out, *Mharu* mysteriously places the crown onto *Armadyl*'s bed, somehow getting it out of *Armadyl*'s bag, stating it was wasteful not to make use of it.
* Time resuming and *Armadyl* aghast, *Mytejager* looks up to see the crown and takes this as an explanation of how he got it the first time: "I told you this thing jumps around!"
* At this point, *Armadyl* puts the crown on and takes the time to re-attune to it before heading out.

### Return To *Vedelem Temple*

* On the way out of the room, *Armadyl* and *Mytejager* come across *Sennin* in the hall who is seated, studying while on watch outside of everyone's rooms.
  * He simply nods as they leave, not questioning it.
* Arriving at the temple, *Armadyl* sets up near the front while *Mytejager* lies down and relaxes on one of the benches further back.
* *Armadyl* starts with meditation and speaking, attempting to start a conversation with *Birkoziik* as normal, but makes little progress other than reactions from the flames here.
* Resolving to doing this the hard way, he sets up everything needed to make use of a Commune spell.
  * Are you there?
    * Of course I am.
  * I haven't felt your presence, your strength, in a long time. I feel so alone without you. Have you been with me?
    * I've seen much. And you've displayed plenty strength your own.
  * I wanted to reach out to you. I was afraid of what would happened if I reached out and got him. Did you know that?
    * I had an idea.
    * *Armadyl* then got flashes of *Birkoziik*'s conversation with *Mytejager*, getting the sense that's when he learned of *Mharu*'s meddling.
    * *Armadyl* also felt a gentle hand on his shoulder, but looked to find nothing there.
* Wanting to ask more questions, *Armadyl* successfully uses Commune a second time.
  * I am in your holiest place. Is there really no more I can do to speak more freely with you?
    * No. (pained, disappointed)
  * Did you hear me back then? Did you feel my pain at the waterfall, or was I just making a fool of myself?
    * No. (seething with anger)
  * Do you still believe in me?
    * I have faith.
* *Mytejager* approaches at this time, inquiring on how things are going, and *Armadyl* notes his middling progress.
  * *Mytejager* deems this acceptable, stating that sometimes they need to put in the work to reach out to them as well.
* *Armadyl* then asks for a bit more time, as he had one last thing to do, to which *Mytejager* agrees and *Armadyl* casts Legend Lore on the brazier.
  * A history of this location is laid out quickly in *Armadyl*'s mind.
  * Originally, this was a meeting place of *Birkoziik* and his forces during the *Pantheistic War*; a large war camp.
  * Later, at the end of the war, celebrations for his armies were held here as well.
  * A city had sprung up around this place, and blueprints for the temple were being presented as part of the city planning.
  * The brazier was fed constantly, but during one harsh winter the practice was stopped to reserve materials; it never went out even after all the wood inside was ash, staying alight to keep people alive and warm within the temple.
* *Mytejager* spends some time trying to figure out how to bottle the eternal flame to take some, but eventually gives up without a solution.
* On the way out, *Armadyl* gets a surprise whisper from *Birkoziik*, breaking the rules, stating he is sorry.
* Finally, the *Crown of Segnis* transformed into its exalted state.
* The two return to the guesthouse and pass *Sennin* with a nod once again, heading to bed.

### Another Visit To *Vedelem Temple*

* In the morning, *the party* gathers up and heads out for the day.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* sends her letter to *Manfred Iranapha* via courier, and is given an estimate of about 3 weeks to go that distance.
* At *Armadyl*'s suggestion, *B. B.* sends to *Balazar Lasa* to let them know they're leaving town.

 > 
 > Heyyyy. Heading to the mall. Let us know if you need anything. Love you, byeeee.

* *The party* then heads back to *Vedelem Temple* to revisit their plans in the fight pit.
  * Upon arriving, they meet with the priest who informs them that the pit is closed today as it is *Albar Ronaro*'s day off (the last day of every month).
  * Questioning the clergy about the eternal flame further, *Mytejager* is still unable to find a way to take some with him.

### On Our Way Out

* Deciding it was time to leave *Teorainn*, *the party* made their way for the northern gate.
* They decided to stop off at the guardhouse there one the way out to get in some last minute questions.
  * *Armadyl*, using the respect *Infinite Eclipse* has garnered in *Marthaag*, asks if he can get information on *Terkol Liongaze*.
  * The response comes as a concern, as they explain: "Old man Liongaze? Haven't seen him in a bit, though I just saw his wife yesterday in the amphitheatre telling her stories."
  * The guards then hand over the address the Liongaze residence, and *the party* makes a sprint for the location to check on them.
* Arriving, *Alenia Eldaloth* scoped out the building as a hawk, seeing a few bugs but not much else.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* and *Mytejager* then make their way in via Fiery Teleport at the back window, exploring the locust-infested building.
  * They quickly find the long-dead bodies of *Teng* and *Terkol Liongaze* in the living room, sucked dry and clean by the abundant locusts.
* *The party* returns to the guardhouse to discretely inform them of what has happened before returning to the residence again.
  * *The party* has *Sennin* use Sending to contact *Balazar Lasa* again, this time to warn him of what happened and that any leads he may have gotten could be a trap.
  * Asking for some time with the bodies, *B. B.* uses Speak With Dead to try and get some information from them.
    * *Terkol Liongaze*'s body is unable to be affected by the spell, signifying someone else had done the same in the last 10 days.
    * *Teng*'s body on the other hand was successfully animated for questioning.
      * Who killed you?
        * I don't know.
      * Did you know that your husband was a member of *The Kin*?
        * I don't know what that is.
      * What's the last thing you remember?
        * We were relaxing, sitting, after dinner. Suddenly, there were bugs *everywhere*.
      * What is the legend of *Aon's Maw*?
        * There are many. The general common point is that it is some sort of scarring left from a divine-level event. It has been used as a location of power through history and legends. The last time someone attempted to go there, they were never heard from again.
      * What do you know about *Aon*, *Dhama*, and *Trit*?
        * The names are familiar, but I can't place them. I don't know.
  * Finishing their questioning, *Armadyl* suggests taking *Terkol Liongaze*'s body to try again later.
    * He convinces a higher-rank guard that they'll need to body to continue their investigation of *The Kin*.
    * Having been on the look out for these people, the guard tells him to take both bodies; they'll keep what happened quiet until he can return them for funerals and report them as missing in the meantime.
  * *Sennin* casts Gentle Repose on the two of them to prevent further decay, and *the party* places them both in the bag of holding.
* Finished with business and wanting to quickly leave town at this point, *the party* once again made for the northern exit to start their travel once again.
