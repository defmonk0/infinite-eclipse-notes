### *Festival of Life*

* *Alenia Eldaloth* informs *the party* about the *Festival of Life*.
  * *B. B.* and *Alenia Eldaloth* go in search of fruit-based alcohols as part of the celebrations, and find some homemade stuff after a jaunt around the small village at the *Dam of Birkozik*.
* Continuing on the path towards *Teorainn*, *the party* begins wrapping around the south side of *The Fuar Range*.
* Completing travel for the day, *Mytejager* volunteers to go hunting for something special to accommodate *Alenia Eldaloth*'s meat-based diet for the holiday.
  * *Armadyl* joins him, and *Mytejager* finds and brings back a Giant Elk for *the party* to eat.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* plants the sapling that came as a result of *Mytejager*'s glaive being used on the beast, and uses Plant Growth to fast-forward it taking to its new home.
* Celebrating with the spoils *the party* had gathered throughout the day, everyone eventually finds a restful sleep as the day comes to a close.
* In the night, *Mytejager* had another dream.
  * This time, the dream depicted a battle with the dragon he has been interacting with, high upon peaks in *The Fuar Range*.
  * The dream quickly ends, seeming to be how the figure and the dragon had met.

### Travels & Truths

* Realizing *the party* is now only about a day out from the *Gnarlwood*, *Sennin* messages *Balazar Lasa* once again, asking where they should meet him.
  * *Balazar Lasa* explains he has been searching the southern half of the *Gnarlwood*, and he could meet them at the southern-most edge to head north together.
* Continuing on for the regular travel day, *the party* sets up camp once again; this time about 4 hours south of the tree-line where they'll be meeting *Balazar Lasa*.
  * *Mytejager* mentions that he had been thinking of home from being so close, but says he doesn't plan to return until his mission is complete.
    * This prompts *Armadyl* to ask exactly what his mission is, to which *Mytejager* explains he needs to bring back something significant enough to prove he is an adult.
    * *Armadyl* questions whether *Mytejager* believes he hasn't yet done enough, and *Mytejager* says that there are bigger prey he wishes to find first.
* One last message is sent to *Balazar Lasa* to clarify *the party*'s meeting place and ETA, so he explains that he'll be able to find the exact location of *the party* once they get close to that southern edge.
* Bedding down for the night, *Mytejager* once again has another dream.
  * This time, repeating the first dream with the glow in the forest, the dragon is mounted and flown in the opposite direction.
  * The hope was to use the mountains behind him as a reference and identify the location, with which *Mytejager* was quite successful and identified the approximate location of the clearing in the *Gnarlwood*.

### Catching Up

* Waking and gathering to continue the trip, *the party* reaches the forest without much issue around noon.
* *Mytejager* used his war horn to signal their location, which enabled *Balazar Lasa* to very quickly appear via magic next to *the party*.
  * While *the party* settled in for lunch, *Alenia Eldaloth* used Commune With Nature to gather some information about the area, including the possibility of some additional giant beasts that might be of interest to her.
* Continuing traveling for the day, *Balazar Lasa* leads *the party* northward through this area of the *Gnarlwood* which he had already been searching, and everyone begins catching up.
  * *The party* explains the situation with *Eolai's Blood Worms* and *Nordri Trueanvil*, expressing concern about how to handle that if and when the time comes.
  * *Mytejager* suggests possibly trying to trap *Nordri Trueanvil* in *Isdaima's Mirror Maze*, which prompts *Balazar Lasa* to offer it up.
    * *B. B.*, with great interest given the name of the item, insists she wishes to hold on to it, which *Alenia Eldaloth* eventually, reluctantly, agrees to.
  * *Mytejager* asks what exactly they are looking for out here, and *Balazar Lasa* explains that he is chasing legends he heard while in *Teorainn*.
    * While searching for *The Kin*, he caught wind that they were asking around about local legends and wives tales.
    * Following this lead, *Balazar Lasa* eventually found an old woman who tells old stories to children in the city, which led him to this particular legend about the *Gnarlwood*.
    * The story told of a possible final battle site during the time around the *Pantheistic War*, and a champion there named *Cerehan* who was known to specialize in handling the unrestful spirits left behind after the war.
    * Hoping *The Kin*'s interest in these legends would also lead them to investigate the locations mentioned, *Balazar Lasa* has been searching the area to find the battle site or run into them.
  * *Mytejager* brings up his interaction with *Birkoziik*, finally letting the drug usage slip, which garnered a reaction out of *Alenia Eldaloth* and *Armadyl*.
    * *Mytejager* offers *Armadyl* some drugs if he wishes to attempt the same method of contact, though expresses some concern about the effects it could have on him.
    * *Alenia Eldaloth* expresses more interest in the actual fight, wondering how that could be possible or reproduceable.
* After a few more hours of talking and walking, *the party* settles up to rest for the night, this time across two Tiny Huts.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth*, with the arcane assistance of *Balazar Lasa* and *Armadyl*, finally manages to figure out the alchemical tool she got from *Willowdusk*, improving the quality of her potions moving forward.
    * *Alenia Eldaloth* has *B. B.* message *Willowdusk* to thank her and let her know, which *Willowdusk* offers to teach more should the opportunity arise.
  * *Balazar Lasa* is informed and learns about *Manfred Iranapha* being *Meriele Iranapha*'s brother.
    * The continued talk also prompts *Balazar Lasa*'s thoughts on his difference in involvement with the outside world in comparison to *Meriele Iranapha*.

### The Trees Have Eyes

* *The party* continues their travel northward, *Mytejager* now taking the lead instead, and stops for lunch again after a few hours.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* once again casts Commune With Nature, learning of a powerful undead presence somewhere north of their current position.
* After lunch, continuing onward, *Balazar Lasa* eventually casts Fly on *Mytejager* to get a better view of the landscape.
  * Seeing the familiar peaks, *Mytejager* is able to recognize the area as the one from his dreams before coming back down to continue leading *the party* towards the clearing he believes to be what they're looking for.
* Eventually, nearing evening and believing to be close to their destination, *Balazar Lasa* once again casts Fly on *Mytejager* to see where they're at.
  * *Armadyl* joins him, and the two take off and quickly note the clearing and direction they need to go.
  * While there, they have a brief conversation about what they might find, and *Mytejager* expresses a thought that it might be some kind of undead dragon, connected to the dreams he has been having.
* Returning to *the party* and passing along this disturbing theory, camp is set up for the night.
  * *Mytejager* has *B. B.* message *Willowdusk* once again, asking if she knew *Shadrix Silverquill* or their descendants, but *Willowdusk* does not.
  * *Balazar Lasa* is obviously concerned about the implications of the dragon theory, but *Mytejager* and he talk about their chances and, while dangerous, they're not outright in over their heads.
* During *Mytejager*'s watch, a subtle familiar glow is noticed in the forest nearby.
  * This prompts him and *Ergan Ilukar* to go investigate it.
  * Traveling for a short bit to follow the light, *Ergan Ilukar* is eventually taken in by some kind of trance-like magic effect.
  * *Mytejager* smacks him to snap him out of it, and a spectral creature reveals itself to be the glow, doing some damage to the two of them.
  * They quickly dispatch the creature via *Ergan Ilukar*'s fire breath before turning back to return to *the party*, not wanting to go further without everyone together.

### Wasted Sleep

* The following morning, *Mytejager* and *Ergan Ilukar* inform the rest of the group about the events of their watch.
* Gathering up to continue travel, *the party* returns to the scene of the events, and then continue towards the clearing.
  * Similar lights eventually are noticed in the area, which *Armadyl* is able to identify as Will-o-Wisps, and *the party* takes note to avoid getting too close.
* Arriving at the clearing and investigating the area, not much of note is found other than these Will-o-Wisps.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* then uses Speak With Plants to talk to the trees in the area, which end up creepy and a little hostile.
  * She learns that whatever they may be looking for seems to only appear at night, that 'he' should be revered, and that 'the trial' awaits.
  * Meanwhile, *Armadyl* has *B. B.* cast Detect Magic, which lights up the whole area in a massive glow of necromantic energy.
* Informing the rest of *the party* that it seems they'll have to wait for nightfall, *Balazar Lasa* sets up Tiny Hut once again to safely relax in while waiting.
  * Nearing sundown, some final prep and spells are cast before the Tiny Hut expires.
* As moonlight floods over the clearing, a massive dragon skeleton becomes visible, half embedded in the earth and dirt.
  * *Mytejager* approaches to look, and hears a voice confirming his desire to partake in the trial.
  * He confirms, and the dragon skeleton begins to rise as battle quickly begins.
