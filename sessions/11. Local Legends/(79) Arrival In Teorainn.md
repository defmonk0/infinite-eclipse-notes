### A Night's Rest

* *Mytejager* and *Balazar Lasa* start talking about the fight.
  * Learn the dragon *Balazar Lasa* and *Meriele Iranapha* fought was about the same size.
* *Mytejager* expresses interest in riding a dragon at some time.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* also has that on her to-do list, and agrees to help work towards that.
* *Balazar Lasa*, taking note of the new *Hallowed Remnant* that was just gathered, asks how many *the party* have managed to gather at this point.
  * It is then shown that all but *B. B.* and *Ergan Ilukar* have one at this point (though *Samantha Carter* hasn't figured hers out yet).
  * During this conversation, *Balazar Lasa* notices that *Armadyl*'s crown is missing, and he inquires about that.
    * *Mytejager* explains he woke up with it randomly one day, and had been holding on to it out of concern for *Armadyl*.
    * *Balazar Lasa* also notes that *Meriele Iranapha* has one as well, but has always refused to elaborate when asked about it.
* *The party* then plans what needs to be done once they reach *Teorainn*.
  * *Balazar Lasa* explains that he needs to head back to *Machairi* to check in at *the scriptorium* (and check in on *Ribble Silverthread*).
* *Armadyl* stepped away for a few minutes to use the Sending Stone to message *Niefendil*.
  * 
     > 
     > In *Teorainn* tomorrow. Will I see you, or are you gone? Any update on Maw? Why the maw? Or anything else. Safe travels. - *Armadyl*
  
  * 
     > 
     > I was until not long ago; had to run an errand with Uklu. Heading to the maw would be dangerous without the three of us. - *Niefendil*
  
  * 
     > 
     > We've been working individually for a bit and haven't had a chance. The maw simply has come up in stories. - *Niefendil*
  
  * 
     > 
     > The danger involved means it hasn't likely been thoroughly investigated, so it seems like a decent lead. - *Niefendil*
  
  * 
     > 
     > I feel it would be dangerous WITH the three of you, given the sensitive nature of our relationship. Regardless, understood. - *Armadyl*

* *Mytejager* and *Armadyl* have a conversation about returning the *Crown of Segnis* given the recent dangers, but they still hold off.
* *Mytejager* begins poking fun with *Alenia Eldaloth* about her resistance to pantheistic influences.
* Conversation began to wind down, and *the party* uneventfully went to sleep for the evening.

### To *Teorainn*

* Everyone wakes up the next morning, gathering their things.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* collects some wood from the surrounding forest for carpentry purposes.
* *Balazar Lasa* teleports *the party* outside the walls in front of *Teorainn*.
* *Balazar Lasa* shows *the party* *The Steed’s Flagon* near the entrance, explaining that is the location of the inn-keeper who had seen *Artlaag*.
  * He then gives a brief rundown of the layout of the city, along with some notable locations, before teleporting himself back to *Machairi* and leaving *the party* to their business.
* *The party* reserved 2 nights in the detached guesthouse at *The Steed’s Flagon*.
* *Ergan Ilukar* mentions in passing conversation that his patron hates goblins, just like he does, which concerns several *party* members and prompts *the party*'s next stop.

### *Vedelem Temple*

* Arriving at the temple, *the party* splits up to go about their business.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* finds a seat in the back and starts talking with a random individual.
    * *Azaki Othronus* is the accountant that handles the finances for the temple.
    * The two have a small conversation about the merits of the temple, eventually bringing about a small understanding on *Alenia Eldaloth*'s part as to why people are attracted to worshipping the gods.
    * It's finally revealed that *Azaki Othronus* is not religious himself either, just works for them, but just kind of gets the appeal.
  * *Mytejager* and *Ergan Ilukar* approach the eternal flames held at the front of the temple.
    * *Mytejager* says *Ergan Ilukar* should dip his head into the fire to cleanse him, which prompts immediate contest and worry from the nearby cleargy.
    * *Ergan Ilukar* does it anyway, lighting on fire, and it does not go out after several attempts from *party* members.
    * After a short bit, one of the priests of the temple returns and splashes him with holy water, finally dousing the flames.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* suggests taking the 'exorcism' of *Ergan Ilukar* to the attached fight pit, to which everyone agrees and files in.
    * *Mytejager* surprise throws *Armadyl* into the pit for a skirmish with *Ergan Ilukar*, and the fight begins.
    * It quickly goes very poorly for *Armadyl*, who avoided doing much in an attempt to goad some sort of response out of *Ergan Ilukar*'s patron in the process.
    * The elvish priest watching over the pit, *Albar Ronaro*, quickly becomes upset for *Armadyl*'s lack of respect for himself and his opponent, incorrectly assumes *Armadyl* was looking to simply punish himself, and tells *the party* to leave.
    * Calming him a bit by explaining the situation with *Ergan Ilukar* and agreeing to go, *the party* says they'll try back tomorrow.
      * *Albar Ronaro* casts a spell to feel out the connections *Ergan Ilukar* has to other powers, noting he still had his connection to *Birkoziik*, but that the sword was also an influence affecting his decision making.
      * On the way out, *Armadyl* requests the same thing be done to him, which prompts *Albar Ronaro* to have him consider who he follows, and remember it.
  * Back in the main hall of the temple, everyone is gawking at the eternal flames which had been flaring a bright white, coming back to rest as *the party* finishes in the pit.
    * After quick inquiry, *the party* learns that's never happened before.
  * On the way out, *Armadyl* notices a crying woman looking his way near the door for a split second before she disappears.

### Shopping

* *Alenia Eldaloth* finds a merchant at the docks to buy ingredients for healing potions.
  * While there, *Sennin* notices a ship with shields mounted on the side with an insignia resembling the symbol on his father's medallion.
  * *Sennin* walks over to begin asking questions and is stopped on the dock by a gnome taking inventory, *Jebeddo Fiddlefen*.
    * The symbol is used as branding, provided by one of their co-founders and previous quartermaster.
    * Flashing the medallion, *Jebeddo Fiddlefen* tells him to wait, and goes on the ship to fetch their captain, and orc woman named *Vorka Durgat*.
    * She explains that *Feari* founded the company with her, and left after 3 years, disappearing without warning the day after randomly explaining that she could find him if she really wanted to look.
    * *Sennin* asks if she has anything of his still laying around, and she blows him off saying she sold all of it in *Calafore*.
* *Sennin* buys an amulet with a dragon engraved on it at a jewelry store.
* *Armadyl* gets some strips of ivory at the same place.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* researches and finds some messenger services to use later.
* *Armadyl* returns to the docks and buys a metric fuck-ton of incense.

### Old Wives' Tales

* *The party* arrives at the small amphitheater they were told the old woman telling old stories could be found midway through one of her legends.
  * The story goes over three flumphs playing hide an seek, and all three hide by turning themselves into bits of nature: wind off some cliffs, plants in a forest, and a volcano.
  * Seems to be some strange twisted way to warn kids to stay away from the nearby dangerous natural landmarks: The *Aethian Crag*, the *Gnarlwood*, and *Aon's Maw*.
* *Armadyl* approaches the old dwarven woman, learning her name is *Teng*, and mentions that *Balazar Lasa* had told *the party* about her.
  * She recognizes 'the pretty purple one' and welcomes everyone.
  * *Armadyl* asks about the Flumphs, and whether they had names, which she couldn't remember.
  * She also admits that her use of Flumphs was just to use some whimsical rare creature as a fill-in for the kids since she couldn't remember exactly what the story was about originally.
  * *Armadyl* asks if the names *Aon*, *Dhama*, and *Trit* ring a bell and could be related, which she says sounds familiar, but it had been so long since she learned these stories as a child herself that she couldn't be sure.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* asks about whether *Teng* heard of the dragonborn cleric who killed themselves in *Vedelem Temple*, which she confirms, noting his name was *Eric Gorunn*.
* About this time, mid-conversation, *Armadyl* received a message in his head.
