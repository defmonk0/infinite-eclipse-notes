### B&E Debriefs

* *Armadyl* and *Rivian* are wrapping up their investigation of *Argelen Grand Jewler*, and preparing to leave.
* *Armadyl* casts one last Detect Thoughts before leaving, fishing for anything else, but doesn't get much.
  * The leftover trap components and subsequent note went unnoticed, and eventually, the man went to go wake *Bethrynna Ofandrus*.
* Meanwhile, asleep back at *The Caring Hero*, *Mytejager* had *a strange dream* from the perspective of another individual, following a glow in a forest with a friendly dragon.
* With everyone arriving back at *The Caring Hero* in staggered groups, everyone went to sleep for the night.

# *368-3-2*

* In the morning, *the party* regrouped at breakfast to discuss everyone's findings from the previous evening.
  * *Mytejager* attempted to determine the forest from his dream while mentioning it to everyone else, but didn't decide much other than that it was not *Prathamika*.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* informed *the party* of the body and spider webs found at *Adam Root*'s, and the various minor clues found around his house.
  * *Armadyl* then informed *the party* that the old man from *Argelen Grand Jewler* was more or less definitely *Fol Narkag*, but that he had also seemed to run away after trapping his room.
    * Current running theory is that he is some kind of Shapechanger, prompted by the various claw marks.
* *Armadyl* decided it might be good to question the body at *Adam Root*'s, so he and *B. B.* took a trip back to do so.
  * Using invisibility and flight, the two entered his house from a back window without too much trouble.
  * *B. B.* cast Speak With Dead.
    * "How ya' doing?" - *B. B.*
      * "I'm dead."
    * "Who did this to you?" - *Armadyl*
      * "A cloaked figure; small. I never saw their face."
    * "What did they feel like?" - *B. B.*
      * "Explicitly unfeeling; like it was just doing business."
    * "How can we most effectively hurt *The Kin*?" - *Armadyl*
      * "Their leader is charismatic, driven; without him, the organization would fall apart."
    * "What advice would you have for those wishing to avenge you?"
      * "I would tell them, do not get involved, less they end up like me."
  * Before leaving the body, *Armadyl* notices prick marks on *Adam Root*'s neck, which could look like a spider bite, but *B. B.* notes they are definitely just two blade marks.
    * *Armadyl* gets the sense this might be staged, and eventually also comes to the conclusion the webs likely came from a Web spell.
  * On the way out, *Armadyl* is also sure to at least disable the trap on the front door, attempting to avoid anyone setting it off accidentally.
  * *B. B.* then speaks with the old gnomish woman across the street, informing her she should contact the *Red Dawn* to check his house.

### Reveals In *Ranafyll*

* Once everyone is regrouped, *Sennin* used Teleportation Circle to send *the party* to *Ranafyll*.
* Once at *the house*, *the party* began searching inside for *Berric*.
  * While doing so, the two guards set up to watch *the house* slammed open the front door and threw an axe at *Armadyl* before immediately realizing who *the party* was.
  * Apologizing profusely, *the party* didn't blame them given their job and told them to take the day off.
  * Some money was taken from the safe for use on the road.
* Heading down the cliffs and into the city, *the party* went to look for *Berric* at *The Merry Deck*.
  * The pub was empty other than a few people passed out or prepping for the next night, including *Berric* face-down at a table.
  * Waking him, *the party* checks in.
    * *Jemir 'Gem' Kenafin* sent a letter, stating they had settled in safely to *Asvarholm*.
  * *Berric*'s memory hasn't focused in while *the party* has been gone, so the group decides to get some diamond dust to try and help with Greater Restoration.
    * *Berric* leads *the party* to a jeweler where they are able to buy the dust directly.
    * While there, light suspicions arise around *Berric*'s personal relationship with *Selma*, the woman working the store.
  * Returning to *The Antumbral Aerie*, *the party* gets to work using the aforementioned magics on *Berric*, fixing his memory.
    * *Armadyl* used Detect Thoughts to once again see the memories of that night, this time revealing the hidden figure to be *Nordri Trueanvil*.
    * Discussing the revelation of the dead man being involved, *Mytejager* noted the described closing of wounds on *Nordri Trueanvil* to resemble worms in the dirt, bringing about another revelation of how he is alive again.
  * *B. B.* then messages *Balazar Lasa*, "We are in *Ranafyll* at house. Planning to head to *Teorainn*. Can we meet you? Have BIG information on desiccated worms. Love you, bye."
    * Still strange about *B. B.*'s messages, *Balazar Lasa* explained he was exploring the *Gnarlwood*, and *the party* was welcome to meet him.
  * *The party* gives *Berric* some additional allowance, and then departs to begin travel towards *Teorainn* and the *Gnarlwood*.

### Travel To The *Dam*

* After a day of travel and *the party* settling in for a night's rest that evening, *Armadyl* used the Sending Stone to message *Niefendil*;
  * 
     > 
     > Greetings; courtesy update. Making our way to the northeast now. About a week out from *Teorainn*. Anything I should know about? Keeping appearances and all.
  
  * 
     > 
     > I'm still in the city. Been continuing to look for clues about the maw. Maybe we'll find a reason to send you out there.

* During his sleep, *Mytejager* repeats the dream from before, this time choosing to mount the dragon to investigate.
  * Eventually he sees a woman as the source of the glow in the trees through the canopy before waking up.

# *368-3-3*

* *Mytejager* is very distracted the next morning, which *Armadyl* notices and inquires about.
  * *Mytejager* explains the dragon dreams were continuing, though that this time he flew on the dragon.
  * He then notes that he didn't do anything to prompt interaction with the gods this time, so he believes these dreams may just be his own, and not some sign.
    * The hint here at his drug use went unnoticed.
  * *Mytejager* also notes that he was not himself, but in another's body, for these dreams, which *Armadyl* notes is similar to his interaction with the *Cognition Obelisk*.
  * *Mytejager* also notes the woman he saw, which leads him to take out his pendant from *Aethia* representing both *Birkoziik* and *Leighas*.
    * Noting another god's influence on him might be good, the amulet is given to *Armadyl*, who puts it on.
* Meanwhile, *B. B.* attempts to get the mini-keg out of the Bag of Holding, but drops and breaks it.
  * Attempting to lose as little as possible, she downs as much of it as it leaks as she can, leading to significant intoxication on her part for the day.
* Around sunset, *the party* finally arrives at the massive cliff-faces of the *Dam of Birkozik*.
  * Settling in for the evening, *Armadyl* and *B. B.* check out the bar & inn, *The Inappropriate Cow*, while *Sennin* sets up the Tiny Hut for everyone else.
  * After having some small talk with the tavern keep, *Armadyl* gets the mini-keg repaired by a man in the bar, *Ristrastyr*, via magic.
  * Sitting down with *B. B.* who was getting another drink, *Armadyl* prompts a conversation, having believed the two had gotten off to the wrong foot in their interactions.
    * *B. B.*, drunk, hilariously agrees they could be friends (which for her, is a BIG deal), which is concerning.
    * Returning to the Tiny Hut, they realize they can't enter it at this point, and get a room at the inn for the night.
    * Eventually, *Alenia Eldaloth* goes to check on them, prompting an intoxicated 180 degree swing from *B. B.*, not wanting to be alone with *Armadyl* anymore.
    * *Alenia Eldaloth* stayed with them to comfort and hush *B. B.* to sleep.

# *368-3-4*

* The next morning, having completed a long rest, *the party* began to stir and the session ended.
