### The Battle

* *Armadyl* came out of the gate with a clutch Bless, continually saving *the party*'s ass.
* *Mytejager* mounted the dragon, attacking it from the back.
* *Ergan Ilukar* managed to get in close and kept the dragon grounded with Sentinel, avoiding the aerial battle.
* *The party* learned the radiant resistances of this particular dragon, requiring a shake-up in strategy.
* *B. B.*, in between Blinks, uses Polymorph to burn a few of the dragon's legendary resistances.
* *Ergan Ilukar*'s fire breath once again has gained strength, doing significant damage.
  * He also hits one of the Will-o-Wisps around the field, prompting many of them from around the battle to also start attacking *the party*.
* Eventually, *Balazar Lasa* used fly on *Mytejager*, allowing him to rotate around to the face of the dragon, rather than holding on to its back.
* *Mytejager* finally gets the killing blow on the dragon, ending the battle.

### Aftermath

* The dragon disintegrated into mist, coalescing into the spectral shape of a glaive embedded in a stone in the middle of the battlefield.
* *Mytejager* tried to grab it, but passed right through, prompting him to place his current glaive into it instead.
  * The spectral form then began to glow, combining with his existing glaive.
  * This automatically attuned to him, shunting the attunement of the cursed ring and ending the curse on him.
* A sapling is left behind, embedded in the rock where the glaive was, which *Alenia Eldaloth* reinforces with plant growth.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* also tried to Speak With Plants to talk to the trees, but got no response after a seemingly rapid death in a radius around the dragon.
* *Sennin* used Detect Magic and realized the large necromantic magic source in the area had dissipated.
* Moving a bit away from the battlefield, *Balazar Lasa* and *Sennin* set up Tiny Huts to prepare to rest for the evening.
