### This Fucking Bakery

* *The party* checked the docks for *The Ashen Serpent*.
  * It hadn't arrived yet.
  * *The Copper Coin* was present.
  * *RMS Gyrdh's Peace II* was dry-docked for repairs.
* *Sennin* used Sending to message *Berric* about the paperwork on *The Kin* promised by *Agnew Solidsgurd* and how to send it.
  * *Berric* confirmed he had it and would send it to '*The Mouse & Beaver Inn*'.
* *The party* then went again to investigate *The Muffin Man Bakery*.
  * *Rivian*, *Sennin*, *Ergan Ilukar*, and *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* went in, while everyone else kept watch.
  * They found some hidden *Devil Weed* in a drawer with *the baker*'s business paperwork, but left it alone.
  * On their way out, *Ergan Ilukar* noticed a subtle fold in a rug on the floor, and discovered a hatch under it.
    * It led into what seemed like an old well under the building.
    * After some effort and froggery to get in and investigate it, *the party* retrieved the skull of a skeleton they found at the bottom.
    * Meanwhile, outside, *Armadyl* and *Samantha Carter* had a brief chat about what her connection to *The Covenant* was.
      * She used to do asset retrieval, returning stolen goods to their owners.
      * Her last big job was returning an expensive magic item, a large ruby, that was taken by *The Covenant* from a wizard based near *Kereskell*.
* Returning to their rooms at *The Beaver & Mouse Inn*, *the party* used Speak With Dead on the skull they found.
  * What is your name?
    * Cristian Sattler, Baker extraordinaire.
  * How did you die?
    * Son took a shovel to his head.
  * Why?
    * A heated argument about a woman he was with that Cristian didn't approve of.
  * What did the woman look like?
    * Poor, dirty brown hair, from the *Upper Trenches*.
  * What year did you die?
    * 352 PD

### A Royal's Fall

* *The party* started returning to the *Marthaag Royal Grounds* to witness the execution.
* *Armadyl* made sure to get close to the front as the execution troop exited *the grounds*.
* As they were proceeding with the execution, *Armadyl* used Detect Thoughts to try and gleam something from those present, but didn't end up getting anything of note.
* Mid-way through, *Lady Arin Raga* left and starting walking back.
* Asking for his last words, *Prince Grund Caebrek* executed *Traubon Brawnanvil* by beheading before taking his leave.
* *Armadyl* turned invisible, and make a quick grab of the severed head via flight before escaping with it.
* On their way out, the guards were prepping a pyre to burn the body.
* Back at *The Beaver & Mouse Inn*, *Sennin* used Gentle Repose to preserve the head.
* While hanging around, *the party* received a message via notebook from *Prince Grund Caebrek*.
  * *Lady Arin Raga* had gone missing during the execution, and no one has found her since her tail wasn't following her while inside the castle.
  * Using locate object to try and find her, *Alenia Eldaloth* didn't get anything while moving around the city and covering most of it.
* Giving up, *the party* went to bed.

### Completing A Deal

* First thing after breakfast, *the party* went to the *Mothfish Warf* to look for *The Ashen Serpent*.
* It was already docked and waiting, so they approached.
* Scaring away the cook who was working on the dock, *Captain Lorelei Short* snuck up on the group to greet them from behind.
* Everyone boarded the boat and went into the mess for some privacy to have a conversation.
  * *The party* explained what had happened with their run in with her client, and she was not inclined to help.
  * *Rivian* used Theive's Cant to knock on the wall and convince her that it was fine.
  * She explained the job and showed the item before coming to a deal to sell it to *the party* for 900 GP and a favor at some point.
  * It was identified as *The Skull Of Razaro*, revealing its name and divine nature.
* Leaving with their new item in their Bag of Holding, *the party* returned once again to *The Beaver & Mouse Inn* to start deciding on a message to send to *Balazar Lasa*.
