### Sleuthing & Scriptorium

* *Sennin* attempted to use Scrying to see where the uncle went, but it failed. 
  * The ring was not destroyed.
* *Rivian* sent *Beaks* to investigate the *Marthaag Royal Grounds* to see what was going on.
  * While outside of their telepathic range, it seems *Beaks* was shot down.
* *The party* split:
  * *Rivian* went to investigate on the underground about any remaining members of *The Ruby Lash* via an information broker.
    * Learned that a vigilante (*Zimi*) had cleared out any remaining deposits of them within the city.
    * Anyone remaining would be individuals trying to make themselves scarce.
    * Rumor is that small groups may have made their way to *Ranafyll* and/or *Caldur*.
  * The rest of *the party* went to the *Machairi Grand Scriptorium & Library*.
    * Read through the requested information about the structure of the *Mistguard*.
    * Also received the information requested under *Rivian*'s fake name from a while back on the *succession candidates*.
    * *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* put in an additional request on information about *the Firbolg tribes* based near *The Beast's Basin*.
* After *the scriptorium*, *the party* head over to check out *The Muffin Man Bakery*.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* used detect magic, and learned of a large source inside that was decidedly likely a large magic oven.
  * It was closed until the following morning, so *the party* simply planned to come back.
* Returning to *The Beaver & Mouse Inn*, *the party* regrouped and relaxed for the evening.

# *367-10-7*

### A Decision Was Made

* Waking the following morning and regrouping downstairs, *the party* could hear a commotion outside.
  * Criers were telling of the events at the castle the previous day and *Traubon Brawnanvil*'s misdeeds.
  * A crowd was forming into protest or riots and heading toward the *Marthaag Royal Grounds*, disgruntled.
* Before checking that out, *the party* checked in on the bakery still.
  * Nothing seemed terribly wrong, and *the woman at the counter* did not recognizing *Lady Arin Raga*, so *the party* bought some goods and moved on.
* Arriving at the gates to the bridge before the *Marthaag Royal Grounds*, *the party* was given a place to wait for an announcement from *Prince Grund Caebrek*.
  * It was announced that *Traubon Brawnanvil* would be publicly executed in 6 hours time for his crimes.
  * Also announced he would have a succession decision within the week.
  * *Armadyl* used Message to ask to talk again, and was told to meet on the west side of the *Marthaag Royal Grounds* at the small docks there.

### Another Meeting

* *Sennin* used Water Breathing on *the party*, and everyone swam (or walked, in *Rivian*'s case) to the appointed spot.
* Invited inside to dry off and warm up, *the party* had another conversation with *Prince Grund Caebrek*.
  * *Traubon Brawnanvil* was found on the grounds and arrested promptly.
  * He admitted to the slave smuggling, but not to the attempt on *Tethren Ignominy*.
  * He is, to an extent, being used as a scapegoat to appease the people, though he would have normally been executed for treason regardless of the attack.
  * *Tethren Ignominy* was investigating an unexpected additional packet among his paperwork that incriminated *Traubon Brawnanvil*, and while reading it was struck from behind.
  * A chef corroborated that *Traubon Brawnanvil* was in the kitchen shortly before the attack.
  * *Traubon Brawnanvil*'s axe would normally be kept in his room, and the only people with keys are *Traubon Brawnanvil* himself, and high ranking guards with access to the skeleton key.
  * *Tethren Ignominy* sent a thank-you note to *Alenia Eldaloth* with a diamond to replace the one they used, to which *Alenia Eldaloth* responded.
* Finishing their chat and getting a boat ride back to land, *the party* set about deciding their next steps.
