### A Conversation With Ti

* *Armadyl* reconvened with *the party* right as *B. B.* decided to pass off her 'dead-people beer'.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* and *Armadyl* went to have a conversation with *Ti*.
  * Learned *Zimi* had been gone for a couple weeks, and everyone assumed she went to look for *Colm Rolen*.
  * *Ti* became the current champ by default after *Zimi* left.
  * *Nagre* has been more careful about letting people in recently due to the circumstance with *The Ruby Lash*.
  * There have been less combatants around, implying some fighters in the past might have been *The Ruby Lash* members.
* On the way out, *the party* spoke again with *Nagre* as well.
  * Got her story of seeing *Zimi* storm out one day, grumpy, and hasn't been back since.
  * Asked for the location of *Zimi*'s home, and got a general area.

### We Can't Just Take The Detour

* *The party* began walking towards the area of the city where the boarding house *Zimi* was known to stay was located.
* On the way, *the party* came across a road block from the guards, with a detour around the block.
  * *The party* took some time to assess what was going on, seeing some individuals being dragged out of a building on the blocked off street.
  * Everyone was severely beaten and some unconscious.
  * Visible signs of a few individuals pointed to them being *The Ruby Lash* members.
* While scoping out the situation, another guard arrived in a hurry to report of another active incident a few blocks over.
  * Taking some of the present guards, and sending a few others to gather reinforcements, they began to run south while *the party* followed.
  * Arriving at a warehouse-like building a few blocks down, sounds of combat were apparent and the guards breached and entered.
  * *Armadyl* flew in the second floor window to try and take the situation by surprise, seeing the last few seconds of someone in a hooded cloak knocking two people out and hopping over a railing to the lower floor.
  * *Rivian*, following a bit behind to be careful of tails, approached the building from the back.
  * A guard was tossed out the front door, and the rest of *the party* entered.
  * The hooded figure finished up the last of their combat and decided to make an escape out a window to the back alley.
  * *Armadyl* and *Rivian* immediately gave chase, but the hooded figure was faster than both of them, prompting *Armadyl* to use Haste on himself to start gaining.
  * After realizing things at the warehouse were settled, *Sennin* also took off a bit behind using Expeditious Retreat.
  * Realizing they were no longer outpacing their followers, the hooded figure ditched left into an alley leading towards a street, disappearing into the crowds before *Armadyl* could find where they went.
  * Using Detect Thoughts to try and pinpoint the individual, *Armadyl* continued to follow the general direction at a slower pace after noting the individual just before they left range.
* Seemingly losing the individual after continuing down the road for a bit, *Armadyl* spotted *Zimi* leaning against the wall of a building under a small awning.
  * Shortly after noticing her, *Sennin* caught up as well; their eyes locked and the two began to have a conversation.
  * *Zimi* was a bit shifty, keeping an eye on the crowds, and the conversation didn't get very far.
  * Just before she went back inside, continuing with detect thoughts, *Armadyl* probed deeper and learned she was very preoccupied with a large locked chest next to the door of the building.
* *Sennin* used Clairvoyance to see just inside the building as they left to go rejoin the rest of *the party* back towards the warehouse.
  * Inside, *Zimi* could be seen wrangling several small children before comforting one and mentioning trying to find their parents.
* *The party* decided to investigate the chest, so a group returned back to the building to try and look inside.
  * A brief setup, disguise, and one lock picking attempt later, *Rivian* found nothing inside and got caught as *Zimi* opened the door to discover him, running him off.
  * Deciding subterfuge wasn't going to work here, they decided to be straightforward with her and knocked at the building to have a conversation.

### It's The Fucking Monk

* A meeting was set up in the alley behind the building a short bit later, where the talk could be had.
  * *Armadyl* and *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* went to attend the meeting.
  * *Zimi* moved everyone into a small attached shed to hide them from anyone watching.
  * *Zimi* had gone to find *Colm Rolen*, but was no successful.
  * During her return, she had a run-in with some individuals with carts, which a child in a cage fell off of as they fled.
  * *Zimi* has been investigating the situation, knocking over hidden *The Ruby Lash* dens before the guards could get to them to set any slaves inside free.
  * Learned some political leader was using the situation to resell the slaves for personal gain (with the help of a select few guards that are also in on it), giving some leniency to *The Ruby Lash* members for silence about the abuse of power.
  * *Armadyl* inquired about the individual, learning the name *Brawnanvil*.
    * Using detect thoughts, he also managed to extract a visage of the man, realizing it was *the prince's uncle*.

### "You've Got To Be Kidding Me..."

* Meeting back up and returning to *The Beaver & Mouse Inn*, *the party* started to have a conversation about what they were going to do next.
* While having some drinks and conversing, *Tethren Ignominy* entered the establishment, disgruntled to find *the party* there, and retrieved the key to his suite before retiring for the evening.
* After wrapping up their conversation, *the party* also went to bed for the evening.
