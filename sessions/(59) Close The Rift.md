### *Armadyl* In The Shadowfell

* Resuming immediately into the battle at hand, *the party* entered the space from the nearest tree to the rift.
* Immediately, while invisible so most people were unaware, *Armadyl* told *Sennin* he'd be back and then burst forward into flight and through the rift.
* Inside, stopping and attempting to quietly take in the surroundings, *Armadyl* found himself on a cliffside path that was winding up a mountain.
* Nearby, two Wretched were munching on the corpse of some kind of woodland animal, and a large, almost salt-flat-like valley sat surrounded by the mountain range.
  * On the farthest side of the range from where *Armadyl* currently stood, a fortification of some kind was atop one of the tallest peaks; maybe a fortress or castle of some kind.
* Among the spikey rock formations in the flats, *Armadyl* recognized large groups of creatures similar to what was encountered on the material plane wandering the valley.
* Eventually, sticking around a bit, *Armadyl* felt a brief and very light pulsing, seemingly arcane in nature, that sped up before peaking and stopping.
  * It was noted that the pulsing seemed to move the creatures in the valley in unison as they moved away from it, and this movement pattern seemed to point at the source of the pulse being the castle in the distance.
* More creatures were noticed coming up the path toward the rift, so after one last keen look, *Armadyl* prepared to leave.
  * Before going, a flying creature was seen among the dark clouds in the sky, purple lightning chasing a set of wings and a lizard-like form; a dragon of some kind.
  * Not wanting to be here too long, *Armadyl* tip-toed back through to rejoin *the party* and the battle.

### Walls Of Fire

* Meanwhile, the rest of *the party* began setting upon the task of closing the rift and defending the druids.
* *Sennin* used Wall Of Fire to make a circle around the portal, damaging many of the creatures at once (and unintentionally trapping one of the druids in the circle near the portal).
* *Alenia Eldaloth* then followed suit, though using her casting in a more defensive stance, trapping *Rivian*, two of the druids, and herself inside the circle, separate from any of the other creatures.
* A couple wretched made it inside, and *Samantha Carter* started blind firing through the wall, managing to still hit and burn the creature with the flaming arrow.
* *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell*, super big, face-tanked most of the remaining danger, having a few close calls and dishing a lot of damage back and forth.
* Wither and Bloom with the Potion of Vitality proved to be an invaluable asset in the fight, keeping *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* in decent shape and stalling the fight into a battle of attrition while the rift slowly closed.

### Psychic Lance Turns The Tides

* *Armadyl*, bursting back onto the scene, immediately incapacitated both of the more dangerous creates while most of the Wretched had been picked off.
* Stuck inside the Wall of Fire with nothing to do, *Rivian* began to hit on the female druid that was inside it as well, distracting her.
  * This led to her missing her timing to cast the rift-closing spell, but luckily *Alenia Eldaloth* noticed and cast it instead, getting the final cast and closing the rift.
* The incapacitation proved to be a major turning point against the remaining creatures, dipping favor of the fight heavily in *the party*'s direction.
* The rift closed, *the party* could focus on the remaining creatures and dispatch them in short time.
* The battle came to an end, and a sight of relief came over the group.
* After a short rest, it was decided to head back to *Prathamika* that night, rather than camp, and everyone began the walk.
* Returning to the village, news spread quickly and a night of celebration picked up in response to the return to normalcy closing the rift should bring.
* After taking part in the celebrations, *the party* settled down for a night of rest.
