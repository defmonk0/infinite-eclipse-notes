### Plan & Prepare

* Learned about the current structure of the invasion's forces.
  * An initial front-force consisting mostly of Wretched will be met with the main force of the *Tala-Raksa*.
  * In a second wave, 8 groups consisting of a mix of Wretched and other, more dangerous, enemies would follow.
    * These groups would be problematic if they reach the front-lines, causing major losses in the mainline forces.
    * Strike teams consisting of more specialized and skilled fighters will engage them before they can arrive on the front line.
    * From previous experiences fighting many of the creatures in these groups, there was inconsistency in the danger posed by these groups.
* *The party* decide they will engage the most dangerous and unknown among them, with *Colm Rolen* coming along for the fight.
  * Plan is for *Rivian* to scout a bit with the help of *Beaks*, and flank for a sneak attack while the rest of *the party* begin the engagement as a distraction.
* While waiting to leave, *Alenia Eldaloth* sent an Animal Messenger to hopefully find *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* to fill him in on what was going on, which was successful.
  * *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell*, exhausting himself, continued the walk back to the forest while carrying the resting *Armadyl*.

### The Fight Begins

* Some time later, shortly after the departure of the main force, *the party* and the other strike teams left *Prathamika* to go join the fray.
* Splitting into multiple groups along the way, eventually, *the party* and *Fithic Rolen*'s group split not far from each of each other's encounters.
* Upon arrival, the plan was executed more or less as expected (though *Beaks* did have a rough go of it), and the engagement started.

### Reunion

* The fight was stressful, with large amounts of damage being dished out and *Samantha Carter* continuously being harried by Wretched.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* went down, but was eventually brought back up by *B. B.*.
* Eventually, *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* heard the signs of battle and managed to arrive, enabling *Armadyl* and himself to join the battle, providing a major turning point via air support and a flank.
* Wiping out the enemy forces, the fight ended with *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* dropping to rest as he was exceedingly exhausted by the day's events.
