### Wrapping Up An Eventful Evening

* *Armadyl* asked about the paperwork *Zimi* got.
  * It essentially acted as a receipt for the sale of the kid and his parents.
  * Has information on the buyer in *Ranafyll*, so she'll be headed there next to try and wrap things up.
    * A man named *Dalgal Silverstone*.
  * The broker listed on the paperwork was *Jelenneth Cithreth*.
    * This is not the first time *Zimi* has seen that name on slave trade paperwork.
* *The party* parted ways with *Zimi* and head back to *The Beaver & Mouse Inn*.
  * Before everyone else's return, *Sennin* took a stab at decoding *Morwenna Dusange*'s notes, found in her lair.
  * Successful, *Sennin* discovered the notes were paperwork outlining her various identities going back at least 400 years.
* When *the party* arrived in the bar, the owner recognized them and delivered a letter to them.
  * Royally sealed and addressed to *Infinite Eclipse*, it was the invite for the meeting with *Prince Grund Caebrek*.
  * The meeting was set for the following day at 5pm.
* Regrouping with *Sennin* in the room, *Alenia Eldaloth* used detect magic to check for any spying eyes.
  * It didn't seem there was anyone watching, but *Alenia Eldaloth* detected a magical presence downstairs in the bar.
  * Popping downstairs to take a quick look, it was identified as a ring on the finger of *a large human sailor*.
  * The magic coming from the ring was of the school of necromancy.
* Returning to *the party*, the group continued their conversation before getting sidetracked by the ring.
  * Everyone exchanged all the information they learned that day on both accounts, and discussed next steps.
  * Also discussed plans for how to go about their meeting with *the prince* tomorrow.

### So About That Ring...

* *The party* went downstairs and took up a table not far from the magic ring group.
* *Armadyl* quickly checked in with the owner to confirm that *Tethren Ignominy* was still at *the inn*.
* Started eavesdropping on the *sailor guy* who was boasting about a recent monster fight on the sea.
  * *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* immediately perked up and went over to them.
  * Learned his last trip was up toward *Brefield* on *The Copper Coin*, and they just got back 2 days ago.
  * A bragging match of trophies and kill stories ensued, eventually resulting in an arm wrestling match.
    * *The sailor* took a quick lead, but *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* tied it back up.
    * Upon showing it was going to be a good match, *the sailor* offered a wager to make it more interesting.
      * Originally saw the rings on both contender's hands and suggested that, but eventually settled on 100 gold.
  * Both contenders eventually slipped, ending the match in a tie, but laughed it off, continuing the new camaraderie through the evening.
  * *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* also mentioned they might have work for their crew in the coming days if they were interested.

### What's That Prick Up To?

* After a short rest here in the bar, *Alenia Eldaloth* became a cat and slipped upstairs to try and check in on *Tethren Ignominy*.
  * *Sennin* immediately noticed and covertly sent his Unseen Servant to repeat the knocking prank he did last time.
  * While checking out the door to the room, *Alenia Eldaloth* was startled by a familiar loud knock, but this time *Tethren Ignominy* answered the door.
  * While finding no one at the door and a bit annoyed before returning inside, *Alenia Eldaloth* got a peak into the room.
    * Saw books and paperwork on the desk, a large lever near the bed, and a couple windows from this third floor.
  * The servant knocked again, and a flustered *Tethren Ignominy* answered again.
    * The Unseen Servant slipped past and pulled the lever, revealing the mirror above the bed.
    * Freaked out, *Tethren Ignominy* gathered his books and fled the room in fear.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* slipped in after his departure to investigate, and simply found notes of *Tethren Ignominy*'s investigation into the other succession candidates.
* The group went to bed after the rest of a night of carousing.

### Shopping & Chores

* *Alenia Eldaloth* and *B. B.* went shopping for a pipe.
  * Eventually, *Alenia Eldaloth* settled on an ornately decorated blown glass pipe.

### The Appointed Meeting

* The evening arrived, and *the party* made their way back over to the *Marthaag Royal Grounds* to attend the meeting with *Prince Grund Caebrek*.
* *The party* was lead up to a large throne-room like space, and through it to a smaller office behind it.
* Inside, *Prince Grund Caebrek* and an old priest were waiting.
* *The prince* had the priest use Zone Of Truth for the meeting before having him depart as well, leaving them to have their conversation.
* *Prince Grund Caebrek* more or less asked what the fuck was up with that, trying to figure out what *the party* wanted and was trying to do.
  * Essentially, it boils down to a few things:
    * They stumbled into information that made them concerned for their home, and thought it important to pass it along: "Our enemies led to your allies."
    * A few of them have distaste for slavery in *The Principality of Marthaag*, and have preferences of who takes power that reflect that.
    * A few members are just along for the ride, helping out their friends with their own goals.
* Content with the answers for the most part, *Prince Grund Caebrek* began getting into the status of the succession candidates.
  * His aunt, *Lady Arin Raga*, hasn't revealed anything interesting since he began having her followed other than a pastry addiction.
  * *Ki'yorl Nirinath* did in fact inform *the prince* about the information *the party* found about *the prince's uncle*.
    * It was slipped that the vigilante who has been raiding *The Ruby Lash* hideouts was a friend, and the person who stumbled across the uncle's doings.
  * Warned *the prince* about the fact that *Lady Arin Raga* is the one who signed the research writ of *Artlaag*, and the general questionable dealings of *The Kin*.
  * He did not find *Kell Munggen*'s description familiar.
  * All agreed they would continue to meddle and inform *the prince* going forward, he provided a magical notebook for sending him private messages if needed.
* As *the party* was being escorted out of the building, a loud scream took their attention.
  * The guard took off towards the sound, and *the party* quickly followed.
  * *Armadyl* was fastest, with *Sennin* and *Rivian* close behind.
  * Turning the corner into a room the scream was revealed to have been from *Tethren Ignominy*, who now lay on the floor in a pool of blood with an ornate and familiar battleaxe embedded in his skull.
  * Over him stood the image of *Traubon Brawnanvil*, who smirked and began casting a spell.
  * *Armadyl*, as the only one present yet, attempted to Counterspell but was not successful.
  * Right as the other *party* members began to arrive to the scene, *Traubon Brawnanvil* disappeared into a flash and puff of smoke.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* brought *Tethren Ignominy* back to life via Revivify, terrified and shaken and keeping his distance.
  * Other guards and *the prince* arrived shortly after.
    * A quick explanation led to a call for *the prince's uncle*'s arrest.
    * *The prince* decided to get them out quickly as he knew they were innocent to not hold them up.
    * *Armadyl* mentioned the use of the spell to escape and *the prince* was confused as "(his) uncle is no caster".
  * After being escorted the rest of the way out of the *Marthaag Royal Grounds*, the spell was recognized as Dimension Door and the session ended.
