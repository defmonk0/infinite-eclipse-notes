### Planning And Information

* They ask *Nielas Cotte* if they know the man.
* They don't get a name through poor descriptions of the murderer.
* They learn about *Aedwin's Abandoned House* and *Aedwin Eynthar*.
* His business partner who passed through a few times matches the description of the murderer.

### Scoping The Abandoned Building

* *Florian* offers to scope the place out.
* *Infinite Eclipse* patiently waits for him to do so.
* Doesn't discover much due to it being boarded up.
  * Two floors, but the top looks unsafe.
  * Barred main door, no other entrance.
  * Windows inaccessible.
* Returns and informs *Infinite Eclipse*.

### We're Going In

* Party leaves to actually make their way into the building.
* Discover *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* also investigating the building.
* Go in with him, pulling the barricade off the door.
* *Infinite Eclipse* goes in and engages a large group of rats.
* The rats are dispatched, but *Ergan Ilukar* is diseased.
* A body is on the floor, which *Infinite Eclipse* prepares to investigate.
