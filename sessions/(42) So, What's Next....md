### One Last Thing

* *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* had to kinda threaten *Berric* about the vampire situation, but he didn't really give a shit.

### Interrogate The Skull

* *Berric* made breakfast and *the party* left him money to do repairs and survive.
* *B. B.* cast Speak With Dead on the skull of *Halis*.
  * How do you decrypt your notes?
    * Carefully, with a cipher.
  * What was the true name of the devil?
    * I do not know.
  * What were the specifics of the contract with the devil?
    * The contract was for vengeance. Kill and turn whoever was responsible for *Halis*'s death. The contract does not end until those responsible are devils in the Nine Hells.
  * How do we get to the devil in the Nine Hells?
    * Planar travel through natural rifts or via spell. Once there, he's likely in Avernus, possible at The Bronze Citadel.
  * What other names does the devil go by?
    * *Ziqur*

### On The Road Again

* After finishing up with breakfast and a spot of necromancy, *the party* head out to start their travel to *Machairi*.
* Choosing to take the shorter route across *The Great Plains Of Raavasa*, the first day of travel was uneventful.
* During second watch of the night, there was a brief incident with a squirrel that got tossed across the plains.

# *367-10-2*

* *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* woke up with a beard from the Belt of Dwarvenkind.
* Continuing their travel, *the party* came across a dilapidated cart that they chose to investigate.
  * Seemed to have been there for quite a while, and there were signs of weapon-based battle.
  * *Samantha Carter* found a gold locket with the initials I.Z. on the back.
  * *Sennin* used identify, but it was a plain locket so little was learned.
* That evening, a few hours out from the bridge, *the party* set up camp and had an uneventful set of watches through the evening.

# *367-10-3*

* Shortly after awakening at sunrise, *the party* began to continue their trek towards the bridge.
* Noticing some flapping in the distance, *the party* realized they were in the sights of a group of large flying beasts.
  * Getting closer, the group saw them as a large group of flying dinosaurs, and combat ensued once they caught up.
  * There were a couple close calls with people being dropped from the sky, but eventually, *the party* emerged victorious.
  * *Rivian* noted to *Alenia Eldaloth* and *B. B.* that he saved them via Feather Falling, and will continue to hold that over them for as long as he can.
