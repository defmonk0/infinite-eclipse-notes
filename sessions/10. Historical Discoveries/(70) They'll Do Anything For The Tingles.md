### What Do We Do About This Meetup?

* The morning began with *Alenia Eldaloth* remembering that *the party* should check in on *Berric*.
  * *B. B.* used Sending to contact him, and everything was fine, though he did poke fun at the month-long gap since the last time they spoke.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* then asked *Armadyl* if he wanted help trying to find the *Crown of Segnis* today.
  * He declined, expressing that the situation was complicated, but didn't need to be pressed.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* disagreed, concerned about the use of her own *Hallowed Remnant*, but *Armadyl* simply (poorly) reassured her it was fine.
* *The party* then discussed what to do with the upcoming meeting with the contact from *The Covenant*.
  * After a bunch of discussion, *the party* resolved that little value was likely to come from this interaction, but *Rivian* and *B. B.* would be disguised as *Tizin* and *Eline* and see what they could do.
  * Everyone then went to the meeting point, and most of *the party* hid inside Rope Trick to be available if needed.

### Oops. Poor Owl.

* The contact arrived, and the conversation began.
  * *Rivian* decided it wasn't going to go anywhere, and so the trigger word was used for *the party* to reveal themselves and quickly dispatch her.
* An owl was seen in the sky by *Armadyl* while looking for other individuals.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* quickly became a Blood Hawk to fly up and attack it, assuming it was with the contact.
  * It immediately died, revealed to be a real owl and not a familiar.
  * Found a letter from *Manfred Iranapha* was sent via the bird, containing the research he had found on the *dessicated worms*.
    * Revealed to be *Eolai's Blood Worms*.
    * Scattered details about its history were discovered via a *Cognition Obelisk* located in ruins on an island in the *Oighir Sea*.
    * An individual was sacrificed to create the worms, and were last known to be taken into a portal in an unknown location.
    * A copy of the information was sent back to the *Machairi Grand Scriptorium & Library* to replace theirs, as that was the original source anyway.
* *Mytejager* searched the contact's corpse and found nothing much of note other than her equipment and small coin purse.
* He then cut off the head to take it with them for questioning later, and *Sennin* used Gentle Repose to stop it from decaying for a bit.

### Let's go TOWARDS The Tingles

* Continuing the trip towards *Argelen*, *the party* continued trekking through the woods.
* Nearing the end of the day's travel, *the party* started to have a weird tingling sensation overtake them, almost like static.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* used Speak With Plants to try and ask the trees about the phenomenon, not getting much information other than the direction of the source.
  * *The party* then decided to go towards them and investigate.
  * *B. B.* used Detect Magic, and saw the faint field of magic everywhere around them.
  * *Rivian* decided to sneak a bit behind the group while *Armadyl* kept pace with the rest of *the party* from above.
  * Getting closer, the magic affects got stronger, eventually willing several members to turn and start walking away from the direction they were going.
  * The members who were able to withstand the effect quickly snapped their companions out of it, and began approaching once again.

### Baby's First Cognition Obelisk

* Eventually getting close enough, *B. B.*'s Detect Magic spell caught what seemed to be the source, a powerful object in a clearing that was emitting every school of magic.
* *The party* approached without much concern, with *Armadyl* and *Sennin* getting closest, with *Armadyl* reaching out and touching the *large, smooth, obsidian pillar*.
  * Very quickly, *Armadyl* was overcome with *visions of memories from the perspective of another individual*.
  * The visions detailed the memories of a follower of *Mharu* during the *Pantheistic War*, witnessing the rise and eventual fall of one of *Mharu*'s champions.
* Snapping out of the visions, *Armadyl* had a nose bleed from the intense experience, which *Alenia Eldaloth* tried to come forward and check on.
* The *pillar* was seemingly relieved its power as part of the process, and *Sennin* reached out as well with no effect.
* The exertion of power seemed to garner the attention of some hidden creatures, which floated out of the bushes around the obelisk and began attacking *the party*.
  * Making himself a target through some bigger moves, *Armadyl* was focused and knocked unconscious during the fight.
  * The rest of *the party* was able to handle it, and healed him before things became too dire, cementing *the party*'s victory.
* After the fight was complete, *the party* discussed what to do about this thing they found.
  * *Ergan Ilukar* reached out to his two higher powers to ask about what these creatures were.
    * No response was received from *Birkoziik*, and his sword was dismissive noting they were dead, and it didn't matter anymore.
  * Eventually *the party* decided it was best to inform *Manfred Iranapha* about their discovery.
    * While trying to decide on a method, *B. B.* simply used Sending to tell him that some things were happening and they could use his help with something.
    * Concerned about the vague message, right as *Mytejager* expressed confusion about why the random stone pillar was something they cared about, *Manfred Iranapha* opened a link to a nearby tree via Transport Via Plants, stepped through into the clearing, and exclaimed, 'How the hell did you find one of these?'.
