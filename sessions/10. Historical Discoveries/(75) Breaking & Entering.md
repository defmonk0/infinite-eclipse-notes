### *Seebo Pilwicken*

* *Mytejager* excitedly greets *Seebo Pilwicken*, beginning to start negotiations to buy more dynamite.
* *Mytejager* and *Armadyl* learn *Seebo Pilwicken* was underpaid the last time they traded for the dynamite, and everything that happened afterward.
  * *Seebo Pilwicken* used his life savings to cover the difference, and hid the transaction in small quantities via other orders.
  * Continuing to use the ruse that a few extra dynamite was used here or there to sweeten a deal and land contracts at appropriate prices, *Seebo Pilwicken* continued to sell dynamite to other small groups, making quite a bit of money.
  * After a time, he doubled down, paying off a few guards to make business easier to find and hide, resulting in his current position.
* Speaking of the amounts of money here, *Armadyl* began to come to terms with how rich *the party* really is.
* *Mytejager* asked if *Seebo Pilwicken* knew of any competitors, hoping to find a lead on the components found at *Argelen Grand Jewler*.
  * *Seebo Pilwicken* did not, and noted the general supply chain and how it would be difficult to produce any significant quantities unofficially.
  * The two then revealed they found about a stick's worth elsewhere, and *Seebo Pilwicken* wasn't concerned.
* *Mytejager* and *Armadyl* then bought 4 sticks of dynamite for 60 pp, about 50 gp per stick more than last time.
  * If they needed more in the future, they could just come by again as it's not unusual to meet with adventuring parties to clear out various work areas.
* *Seebo Pilwicken* then noted that, if they're interested, he does have some work for adventurers at the moment.
  * The first was a delivery of dynamite to conclude a sale with a undisclosed buyer in *Caldur*, as he had no infrastructure to smuggle it through the gates yet.
  * The second was to quietly have a hand in removing someone above *Seebo Pilwicken* in the hierarchy of the business, but little else was mentioned.
* The delivery to *Caldur* raised some red flags for *Armadyl*, so he used Message to have a private conversation about it here.
  * A regular buyer had met a contact in *Caldur* who was interested in purchasing a decent quantity, but *Seebo Pilwicken* didn't know exactly who they were.
  * *Armadyl* noted they were aware of some growing conflict there, and noted him to be cautious doing business there if he wanted to keep a low profile, which *Seebo Pilwicken* appreciated and would take it into consideration with how he proceeded.
* *Mytejager* also noted that, if business continues to go well, he subtly said he might be able to introduce *Seebo Pilwicken* to *Black Buck* for a business arrangement.
* It also came up that *The Covenant* has reached out, but *Seebo Pilwicken* was unable to supply the quantities they would be interested in.
* At this point, everyone said their goodbyes and *the party* regrouped outside of the quarry.
  * *The party* then used Telepathic Bond to discuss the possible job while walking back to *The Caring Hero*.

### Meeting *Eccacia*

* On the way back, *Alenia Eldaloth* and *B. B.* split off to look for a book store.
* Unable to find anything specific to what they were looking for, they eventually resign to visiting a store they learned about while asking around, *Eccacia's Surprise Souvenir & Curio*.
* The shop was flooded under high tide, but the two of them proceeded inside anyway, finding the Water Genasi owner standing behind the counter.
* Taking a quick look around, a variety of spell scrolls and magic gear was among the varied stock of the shop.
* After paying for a few things and conversing with the owner, *Alenia Eldaloth* and *B. B.* regrouped with *the party* at the *The Caring Hero* and let them know what they found.

### Regroup & Plan

* A recollection of the various items at *Eccacia's Surprise Souvenir & Curio* prompted a return trip from *Samantha Carter* and *B. B.* while others made plans for the evening.
  * *Samantha Carter* bought The Eyes Of The Eagle goggles.
  * *B. B.* attempted to Charm Person *Eccacia* to get a discount on the item, but failed, playing it off as a Fey tick.
  * This seemingly went unnoticed or uncared by *Eccacia*, and conversation continued to *B. B.*'s origins and his own.
    * *Eccacia* is from the Water Plane.
  * While speaking, a plop and thunk came from behind the counter, which prompted *Eccacia* to pick up some armor that seemingly came from nowhere and place it on a shelf.
* Meanwhile, *the party* planned their B&E's for the evening.
* One group would go to check on *Adam Root*, while the other would return to *Argelen Grand Jewler* and attempt to question the old man, assumed to be *Fol Narkag*.

### Group 2

* *Samantha Carter* and *Alenia Eldaloth* dropped *Ergan Ilukar* and *B. B.* off at a bar, and proceeded to *Adam Root*'s house.
* Once there, *Samantha Carter* stood watch while *Alenia Eldaloth* transformed into an owl to try and scope an entrance.
* Finding a window into an office in the back of the building, *Alenia Eldaloth* waited for the coast to be clear and then used Misty Step to appear inside.
* Searching around, *Alenia Eldaloth* found the building musty and stagnant, likely unused for a time.
* Exploring the rest of the building, *Alenia Eldaloth* passed the opening to the kitchen while nearing the living room, and found a sticky floor and a desiccated corpse attached to the upper wall by a smattering of spider web.
* Assuming this was a dead *Adam Root*, *Alenia Eldaloth* returned to the office to search for paperwork hoping to possibly find a connection to *The Kin*.
* Eventually, a hidden space was found, dusty, but with a cleaner space that looks like something might have already been removed.
* Upstairs, a book with removed and burned pages was found, and the cover was in a trash can, which *Alenia Eldaloth* took just in case..
* Another window was found on this floor, and *Alenia Eldaloth* turned back into an owl and flew back to *Samantha Carter* to regroup.
* Meanwhile, the same old woman from earlier checked in with *Samantha Carter* standing outside, eventually bringing her lemon bars and leaving her to her business.

### Blue Falcon

* *Armadyl* and *Rivian* proceed to a bar down the street from the *Argelen Grand Jewler* to scope out the building.
* Eventually, a few of the lights go out, and the two decide they would invisibly fly to the window at the old man's room.
* Doing so, they found one of the windows open, but the curtains were drawn shut.
* Peeking inside, they found the drawers turned open and the bottles missing or emptied, and some sort of tripwire spanning the middle of the room.
* *Rivian* moves inside, while *Armadyl* does a loop around the building before joining him.
  * It's hard to see in the other windows, also curtains drawn shut, but could see at least one individual in bed in the other bedroom.
* Investigating the tripwire, *Rivian* discovers it's a trap connected to a stick of dynamite under the bed.
* They also note a set of claw marks on the inside of the windowsill, looking like something was making an exit.
* Carefully proceeding past the trap, the two explore the building, finding recently burnt paper and ash in the fireplace, unable to discern anything on them.
* Eventually proceeding to the other bedroom and peaking inside, they found *Bethrynna Ofandrus* and what was assumed her husband.
  * *Armadyl* uses Detect Thoughts to pull some information from their sleeping forms, seeing dreams from each of them.
  * The husband was dreaming of their theoretical future children, while *Bethrynna Ofandrus* was dreaming of selling the magic wares downstairs to *Armadyl*, which posed a scare.
* Not wanting to wake them, they closed the bedroom door again, uneventfully checked the shop downstairs, and proceeded back towards the room they entered from.
* *Rivian* took the time to disable the trap and recover the extra piece of dynamite while *Armadyl* left a note in its place that said "We need to talk". As he was wrapping up, the man could be heard stirring as they escape out the window.
* One last detect thoughts prompts a read from the man, now in the old man's room, thinking 'where's Uncle *Fol*?'.
