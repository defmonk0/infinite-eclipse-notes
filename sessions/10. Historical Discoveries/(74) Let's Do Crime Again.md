### Trouble Brewing

* After completing their meal, *the party* started prepping for bed for the night.
* *Armadyl* received a page in the magic notebook from *Prince Grund Caebrek*.
  * 
     > 
     > Currently on the way to *Caldur* to investigate...unrest. Informed that the *Mistguard* in *Teorainn* have heard rumors of *the Tortle* you are looking for, and also aware of a Tiefling gentlemen also looking for *the Tortle*. 

* After reading the note aloud to *Mytejager*, *Armadyl* took first watch.
  * During this, *Armadyl* uses the Sending Stone to message *Niefendil*.
    * 
       > 
       > You wanted *Adam Root* dead. Why?
    
    * 
       > 
       > Interesting. Well, he had been helping with some financial trading. He started using those connections for his own gain, and became risk.
  
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* took second watch, uneventful other than a brief interaction with a moth at the window.
  * Final watch was handled by *B. B.*, also uneventfully.

# *368-3-1*

### 'Shopping'

* The following morning, *the party* regrouped and had some breakfast.
  * *Armadyl* had a conversation with *Ivellios Caphax*, asking around about *Adam Root* and where he might be found.
  * *Ivellios Caphax* was happy to oblige, and provided a rough map of the area in which *Adam Root* lives.
* Afterward, *Armadyl* also informed the rest of *the party* about *the prince*'s message from last night.
* Completing breakfast, *the party* head out towards the *Argelen Grand Jewler*.
  * Arriving there, everyone went in to be greeted by *Bethrynna Ofandrus* behind the counter.
  * Doing some brief shopping to keep the interaction casual, *the party* notices some magic jewelry in the shop, notably a Ring of Mind Shielding.
  * Asking about who made them, *Armadyl* used some magic influence to convince *Bethrynna Ofandrus* to introduce *the party*.
    * Sending a worker with a message to do so, *the party* learned the name of the enchanter, *Mindan*.
  * *B. B.* and *Alenia Eldaloth* step out of the shop to find a place to Sending *Balazar Lasa*.
    * 
       > 
       > Heads up. Prince aware someone else also looking into things in *Teorainn*. We have not mentioned to him that you're connected to us. Love you.
    
    * 
       > 
       > Ooooookayyy. Good to know that word is getting around. Being less subtle, hoping to draw them out.
  
  * *Mytejager* brings up the Ring of Mind Shielding could help *Armadyl* with his *Crown of Segnis* problems.
    * Inquiring about the price, *the party* learns the Ring costs a lot (1600 pt), and similar for a few other pieces.
  * Continuing to chat, *the party* learns that *Bethrynna Ofandrus* lives above the shop with her human husband and some of his family.
    * The business was originally her husbands, and was inherited from his side of the family. 
  * Asking about the Goliath guard out front, *Mytejager* learns their name as well: *Jonta*.
    * *Jonta* had trouble finding jobs within the city, but ended up a perfect fit for protecting the business.
    * It was also noted that *Jonta* has lived in the city since he was a young boy.
  * *Armadyl* sends a quiet Message to *Rivian*, asking him to check out the upper level of the building.
    * Agreeing, *Rivian* heads outside, turned invisible, takes a Potion of Climbing, and climbs the side of the building to the second floor.
    * Eventually entering a master bedroom window, he begins investigating.
      * Finds an old man in a rocking chair, thin and frail, eyes whited over and likely blind.
      * Finds a large crystal ball, decorative but expensive, in the bedroom.
      * Finds a hidden drawer in what seems to be the old man's bedroom, containing various materials, of which *Rivian* takes a small amount.
    * Heading back out the way he came, *Rivian* regroups outside with *Alenia Eldaloth* and *B. B.*.
* Everyone else eventually emerges from the store, and head to a quiet cafe down the street recommended by *Jonta* after prompting from *Alenia Eldaloth*.

### Discussion and *Adam Root*

* Taking a seat and settling in for a short break, *the party* discusses what *Rivian* found.
  * The components he took turned out to be the underlying components for dynamite.
  * The old man might be *Fol Narkag*, the individual *the party* is looking for, and how they may want to proceed with him.
* Deciding that was an follow up for later in the evening, *the party* moves on to begin their search for *Adam Root*.
  * Proceeding to the location described on the map from this morning, *the party* finds the *Root* family home pretty easily.
  * *B. B.* drunkenly attempted to pick the lock with a screw, and was unsuccessful.
  * Noticing *the house* and yard was a bit overgrown and unkempt, *Armadyl* attempted to message *Adam Root* from outside, and got no response.
  * An older gnomish woman noticed *the party*, and checked in.
    * Speaking with her for a short bit, *Armadyl* convinces her *the party* is just looking for an old friend and she notes that she hadn't seen him come or go in some weeks.
  * Continuing the investigation for a short bit, *B. B.* also discovered the entrance is trapped.
* Since both leads require some nighttime recon, *the party* decides it might be best to split into two groups and come back tonight.

### The Search For Dynamite

* While waiting for nightfall, *the party* then moves on to finding more dynamite to add to *Mytejager*'s arsenal.
* Proceeding to the far side of the city, *the party* returns to the quarry they 'purchased' at the dynamite the last time they were here.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* kept *Sennin* and *B. B.* outside to wait to avoid them attempting any shenanigans like last time.
* *Mytejager* and *Armadyl* head in, leaving the rest of *the party* behind.
  * The two of them enter an office and weave a tale of how they're from *The Caldur Peaks*, and are looking for supplies to help them expand out there.
  * Some sort of manager and a guard are brought down to speak with them.
  * They're offered used mining equipment at a discount, but mention of dynamite is met with explanations of its restricted nature.
  * Pushing the lie a bit further, *Armadyl* implied they are in fact approved for dynamite usage, naming *Arai Yaeldrin* as their previous contact.
  * Taking it at face value, the guard begins escorting the two of them towards the Archguard's office to sort out the situation quicker.
  * On the way, *Armadyl* picked up that the guard was being a little off, trying to determine if they were legitimate or not.
    * It didn't feel like he was fishing to get them in trouble though, so *Armadyl* asked about if there was...any other, quicker and less tedious option for getting dynamite.
  * Easily persuaded, the guard said "Let's go see *Seebo*." and instead took *Armadyl* and *Mytejager* to another office building, overlooking the quarry.
    * Once inside, they were lead into a secluded office containing several guards flanking the exit and overlooking the room from balconies above.
    * Worried this might have been a trap, a quick look to the desk in the center revealed the gnomish man *the party* had extorted dynamite from last time, now known to be *Seebo Pilwicken*.
    * 
       > 
       > You've got to be kidding me. It's you bastards again.
