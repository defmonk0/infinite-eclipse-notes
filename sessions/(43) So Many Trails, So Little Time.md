### Arrival In *Machairi*

* Continuing onward to the city, *the party* climbed the plateau leading into the fortress above *Machairi*.
  * There was stepped up security, including a line of people awaiting entrance into the city.
  * *The party* sidestepped the wait, and learned the increased security was a result of the hunt for members of *The Ruby Lash*.
* Descending into the city and crossing town, *the party* made their way to the *Machairi Grand Scriptorium & Library*.

    * Learned his writ was signed by *Lady Arin Raga*.
    * *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* gave the Ring of the Spying Eye to *Sennin* to look into his whereabouts later.

    * *Lady Arin Raga*
      * Continues to remain a strong runner, though no longer the obvious pick.
      * Less known for the security strength than *the prince's uncle*, a military man.

      * Arrived in the city a few days before *the party* via teleportation.

    * *Ki'yorl Nirinath*
      * Not doing well since the attack.
      * Focus has shifted away from his domestic issues and towards security, which he is not a strong candidate for.

### Back To *The Water & Tale Bar*

* While walking to the next destination, *Armadyl* split off from the rest of *the party* and gave some coin to get a room for him.
* The rest of *the party* reserved some rooms at *The Beaver & Mouse Inn* and then went to *The Water & Tale Bar*.
* Descending in to *The Stone Pit*, *the party* saw that *Tiberious* was currently in the champion's seat, and *Zimi* was nowhere to be found.
* Taking up seats and getting beers, *the party* settled in for an evening at the pit.

### More Bird Shit

* *Armadyl* flew high above and towards the *Marthaag Royal Grounds*, covertly arriving at *Athjar Jaum Bastion*.
* Finding the same dining hall as last time, *Armadyl* made himself invisible and dropped down to the windows overlooking the room.
* Inside, a tense meal was being had, with *Prince Grund Caebrek*, *Lady Arin Raga*, *the prince's uncle*, and *Ki'yorl Nirinath* in attendance.
* Watching what happens for a while, *the prince's uncle* eventually spoke up about *Prince Grund Caebrek* making a decision and stormed out of the room.
* As everyone else finished eating, *Armadyl* used Message to speak with *Prince Grund Caebrek* like last time.
  * It was obvious *Prince Grund Caebrek* didn't quite buy the conscience anymore, though it seems he still didn't have full understanding of how the communication was taking place.
  * *Prince Grund Caebrek* explained the tense atmosphere, alluding to him losing his patience with his uncle and threatening him.
  * *Prince Grund Caebrek* definitely agreed something was strange about the situation with *Lady Arin Raga*, and planned to start using more intense methods of looking into it soon.
  * Learned of *the prince's uncle*'s distaste for *The Dominion of Siresia*.
* As the meal wrapped up and *Prince Grund Caebrek* began to leave the room, *Armadyl* was told to request a more formal meeting if he wished to continue this.
* With a parting feather left to the prince, *Armadyl* made his way back out of the dining hall and into the sky, heading towards *The Water & Tale Bar* to meet up with the rest of *the party*.
