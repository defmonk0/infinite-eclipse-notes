### Chores In *Caldur*

* *Florian*'s disguise wasn't perfect, barely noticed by a few people.
* Turned the [Clockwork Assassin](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/1777893-clockwork-assassin-puppet) in to the guard.
* Learned *Black Buck* is prolific throughout *The Principality of Marthaag*.
* Showed note from *Griswold Dusange*, mentioning *Morwenna Dusange* and threatening *Gilian Edmur*.
* Given a bag of gold as a reward for the puppet, noting it wasn't much since they hadn't known about it to get an approved bounty (210 GP).
* *Florian* went to see *Finny Bere*, tell him about how his job wasn't going to work.
* Learned a bit more about *Black Buck*, including: 
  * How dangerous they are.
  * How much money they're worth (an old wanted poster for *Griswold Dusange* worth 20k GP, from 3 years ago).
  * They control the political landscape of *Ranafyll*.
  * A known altercation was had with the tavern owners in *Ranafyll* about the ale being sold. It quickly went the way of *Black Buck*.
* Rest of *the party* went to *Caldur Steel*.
  * Met the owner & apprentice.
  * Bought some basic weapons and supplies.

### On The Road Again

* Headed north towards their Goblin-killing quest.
* Named the horse: *Chestnut*.
* Summoned and introduced bird friend, *Beaks* and *Tempris*, had them help keep watch on the road.
* *Florian* filled in *the party* on what he learned from *Finny Bere*.
* *Sennin* was able to finish decoding *Gilian Edmur*'s notes.
  * Written like a journal.
  * Details *Black Buck*'s request for a construct to carry out covert operations and assassinations.
  * Using transmutation to modify souls.
  * Using conjuration to amass essence form the Abyss to help shatter a soul.
  * Using necromancy to transfer and bind a soul into the construct to give it more autonomy (a basic golem wasn't adaptable enough).
  * *Gilian Edmur* went insane from a mix of Abyssal influence and a partial soul, attempting to find more strong souls to replace the part in the puppet his and regain it.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* shared what she learned from *Burning Lands - A History of Conflict in Semoor*.
* Arrived at the small forest near the base of the mountains, NW of *Caldur*, where they were told they could find the Goblins.
* Approached the smoke they believed to be the Goblin camp.

### [The Goblins](https://www.dndbeyond.com/encounters/78225a81-f2b1-477f-b916-f5bb0ed3ce77) Have [A Friend](https://www.dndbeyond.com/encounters/5577cdb8-2996-4cc8-a196-b039d6f224c6)

* Snuck up on the Goblins and got off a free round when kicking off the conflict.
* Made quick work of the Goblins, unleashing quite a few higher-levels spells at them.
* An [Ettin](https://www.dndbeyond.com/encounters/5577cdb8-2996-4cc8-a196-b039d6f224c6) was hanging out in the cave in the mountain just above the camp, and came to help his Goblin friends.
* The giant hit hard, but was also struck down before he could do enough damage to cause any casualties.
