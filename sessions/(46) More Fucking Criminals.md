### Meeting With A Monk

* In the underground bar, *the party* had a conversation with *Zimi*, looking for leads on *The Ruby Lash* hideouts.
* She was following up leads on the kid she was attempting to help out.
* Currently tracking a guy to follow him around and find information.
  * He was across the room getting some food and drink before his shift at their warehouse began.
  * *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* wanted to hit people, so *the party* was down to help out even though it had nothing to do with *The Ruby Lash*.

### A Hideout Full Of Fuckers

* As he starts to head out, *Alenia Eldaloth* uses Pass Without A Trace to assist in following him.
* Followed him to the warehouse on the waterfront in *Wide-Berth Quay*.
* Once everyone was ready, *Zimi* rocked up and just spartan punched a fucker to start things off.
  * The fight proceeded with a number of enemies focusing in from around the room.
  * The magic caster proved to be an annoyance with a variety of hard-hitting spells being used on the grouped-up *party*.
* Eventually, all except 2 individuals were defeated and the questioning began.

### Search The Place

* *Zimi* started searching the office for whatever information she could find.
  * *Armadyl* joined her in the search.
  * Found some paperwork relevant to *Zimi*'s goals, and some other encrypted stuff with a symbol on it.
  * *Armadyl* then rejoined the rest of *the party*.
* *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* and *party* questioned the two individuals.
  * Starting with the conscious grunt, *the party* didn't get very far.
    * Eventually, *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* gave up on him and killed him.
  * Moving on to the unconscious leader, *the party* learned his name: *Irvey Munna*.
    * Their particular group smuggled antiques and rare items and they were in town for a job.
    * *Armadyl* used a deep diving Detect Thoughts to get the name and visage of their current client, one *Kell Munggen*.
    * After slowly giving small bits of more inconsequential information, *Irvey Munna* eventually clammed up after having recognized *Samantha Carter*.
      * *Armadyl*'s detect thoughts revealed underground wanted posters for her.
      * The paperwork found earlier was identified to have the symbol of *The Covenant* on it, and *the party* learned that *Samantha Carter* has a bit of a history with them.
      * *Irvey Munna* explained that giving information to anyone blacklisted by the organization is tantamount to treason, and the punishment is death of everyone they love.
    * Eventually, *the party* convinced him to talk a bit more.
      * *Kell Munggen* was some rich guy from the *Marthaag Royal Grounds*, possibly an accountant or banker of some kind.
      * He's paying a lot of money to have a particular item brought in.
      * It's being smuggled in on *The Ashen Serpent* in the next few days.
  * Eventually, *Armadyl* convinced *the party* to let him live, with him explaining he'd be heading to *Brefield* to hide so he shouldn't ever purposely cross paths with *the party* again.
  * After wrapping up, *the party* and *Zimi* left the district and the session ended.

### Meanwhile

* *Sennin* continued working on the Feather Falling scroll back at *The Beaver & Mouse Inn*.
* In the downtime, *Sennin* also decoded the notes from *Halis* found after dispatching him and the devil.
  * The notes incriminate Halis, Morwenna, Griswold, and Black Buck as a whole for drug trade in the Ranafyll area.
