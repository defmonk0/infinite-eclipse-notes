### Let's Message Everyone

* Sent a message to *Lady Arin Raga* to check in on her if possible.
  * "Lady Raga, Prince Grund seeks your audience. He requests the comfort of family in his grief at this time. Where are you? *Infinite Eclipse*."
  * Responded: "He'll be fine and you needn't worry."
* Sent a message to *Prince Grund Caebrek* to update him on *the party*'s progress investigating her.
  * "Couldn't magically locate Lady Raga via her cape. Spoke to her via sending, she claims "we needn't worry" where she is. We are at dead end."
* Sent a message to *Balazar Lasa* to feel out his thoughts on the situation.
  * "Traubaun executed for treason, murdered Tethren but we revived. Raga missing, possibly left *Machairi*. How goes your efforts? Should we meet? May leave soon."
  * Responded that the political activity is certainly interesting, and that he has some basic information on *the party*'s devil problem as a start. He'll stop into *Machairi* tomorrow and can update everyone then.

### A Trip To The Scriptorium

* After sending all these messages, *the party* went to the *Machairi Grand Scriptorium & Library*.
* Goal was to see if there was a response to *the party*'s request for information on *the Firbolg tribes*, and to see if *Ribble Silverthread* would help research *The Skull Of Razaro* on the down-low.
  * Meeting with *Ribble Silverthread* in a private room, *the party* explained everything.
  * The research request was not yet approved, as it was escalated for higher access.
  * *Ribble Silverthread* was willing to help as best he could, though restricted information would be impossible to get without the paper trail.
  * Learned several things about *The Skull Of Razaro*:
    * No one is really sure what it is used for or does.
    * It was found in 311 PD on an island near the *Vallsoto Reef*.
    * In 345 PD, it was stolen from *Kereskell University* and hasn't been recovered.
  * Also learned of the most recent recovered artifact, the *Kiss of Torunn*, which is known to protect its wearer.
    * Found on an expedition to the islands in the *Oighir Sea*, and was in a vault that took some years to open.
  * Also learned that academic name for these artifacts refers to them as '*The Hallowed Remnants*'.
* Also asked *Ribble Silverthread* if he knew *Kell Munggen* (or anyone of his description), which he did not.
  * *Ribble Silverthread* considered this strange, and there are not many gnomes in *Machairi*, especially when you limit it to individuals of influence.
  * Working at the *Machairi Grand Scriptorium & Library* networks you with a lot of the wealthier folks of the city.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* posited that *Kell Munggen* may be a cover for someone in *The Kin*.

### Rich People

* After getting some lunch, *the party* started to investigate a bit to try and find information about *Kell Munggen*.
* *The party* decided to go to a large bank in *Laz Square*, an area of extreme wealth in the *Marthaag Royal Grounds* district.
  * Using the excuse of their large sum of money *the party* recently acquired, a meeting was set up with an individual from the bank under the guise of financial advice.
  * During the meeting, *the party* inquired about *Kell Munggen* as some they were recommended to talk to, and were hoping to at least give him a chance first.
  * The banker was familiar with the name, though had not personally worked with him.
  * The banker retrieved what information he could on how to contact *Kell Munggen*, and offered an address to *the party* to try and find him.
  * Also mentioned that he would be in for a meeting with a client on the 4th of *1 - Fuar*, next week, as well.
* *The party* immediately went to investigate the address, and found a boarded up apartment building that had been for sale for some time.
  * Breaking in and taking a look around, *Alenia Eldaloth* and *B. B.* didn't find anything of significant interest.
  * Guards eventually came to investigate a report of something strange going on in the area, and those inside made a covert escape.
  * One of the guards did clock a red bird-like individual carrying something away from the building, but nothing came of it.

### Calm Rest Before The Storm

* Returning once again to *The Beaver & Mouse Inn*, *the party* settled in for the evening.
* *The sailor from the other night* was there, so *the party* had brief conversations with his group as well.
  * *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* hinted at the existence of *The Stone Pit* in *The Water & Tale Bar*, challenging him if they ever met there.
* A message from *Prince Grund Caebrek* came via magic note, explaining that his aunt had returned about an hour earlier, and his tail on her would watch even within the castle from now on.
* After a night of hanging out, *the party* went to sleep.

### Well, Fuck

* During the night, *Armadyl* had a familiar dream.
  * *Birkoziik*, casual as always, warned of the nature of *The Skull Of Razaro*.
  * Also noted that other people were after it, and that *Armadyl* was familiar with them.
  * *Birkoziik* mentioned they had acquired it during the *Pantheistic War*, but hadn't really figured out exactly what it was for.
  * He was fearful that dangerous things were in movement, and it was time to get a move on, waking *Armadyl* from his sleep.

# *367-10-9*

* Waking and looking around the room, *Armadyl* saw the room he shared with *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* was a mess.
  * Items were scattered across the room, and it began to dawn on him that it was the contents of the Bag of Holding.
  * He quickly woke *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell*, realizing *The Skull Of Razaro* and any other magical item was missing from among the contents, which spread to waking the rest of *the party*.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* attempted to use Locate Object to find *The Skull Of Razaro*, and got no pings.
* The party departed *The Beaver & Mouse Inn* to start covering more of the city with the spell while heading towards the lift out.
* *Samantha Carter* noticed the smell of cinders, and looking back to the north, saw smoke rising from the north edge of the *Moonlight District*, the area containing *Machairi Grand Scriptorium & Library*.
  * *Armadyl* carried *Alenia Eldaloth* to fly there quickly while the rest of the party proceeded to the lift to gather information.
    * The lift had been closed for hours due to the smoke from the fire making it impossible to breathe in the shaft.
    * At this point, the rest of the party turned around to head towards the *Machairi Grand Scriptorium & Library* as well.
  * Upon arriving, *The Scriptorium* was a chaotic mess and blockaded by guards.
    * Recognizing *Armadyl* and *Alenia Eldaloth*, a guard let them into the courtyard to help however they could.
    * Noticing him sat next to the main entrance to *The Scriptorium*, the two of you approached a dejected looking *Balazar Lasa*.
      * With a thousand yard stare he explained there was an attack in the night, a Tortle who lit part of the restricted section on fire and attacked anyone in his way.
      * *Balazar Lasa*'s eyes focused in anger as he explained that he would find them and kill them, would get revenge, and that *Ribble Silverthread* was among the victims.
