### A Momentous Return

* Preparing to leave, *Balazar Lasa* begins to head out after *The Kin*.
* *Armadyl* stops him as the rest of *the party* is arriving, asking if anyone has a diamond worth 500gp or more.
* *Balazar Lasa*, realizing what he was referring to, runs inside *the Scriptorium* to retrieve a tiara which he promptly ripped the diamond out of.
* *Armadyl* began using the diamond and the power of his boon from *Birkoziik* to push his powers to a higher level, enabling him to begin a ritual to cast Raise Dead.
* Meanwhile, *Sennin* asked around to find anything to aid in Scrying on *Artlaag*.
  * *Taklinn*, the grumpy old dwarf who they have met in *the Scriptorium* several times, offered up a blade with some of *Artlaag*'s blood on it.
* Using the Ring of the Spying Eye, *Sennin* used Scrying to get a visual of *Artlaag*.
  * Was speaking to other individuals out of the perspective of the spell.
  * Was on a rocky outcropping in rougher waters, and was soon diving beneath the waves and into an underwater cave.
  * Eventually revealed the cave led to a hidden cavern where the spell ended.
* After some discussion about the conversation *Sennin* had seen, *the party* determined they were most likely at *Kinzaas' Cliffs*.
  * *Balazar Lasa* explains he can get everyone there via teleport, but only one trip for the day.
* After the ritual was complete, *Ribble Silverthread* returned to consciousness having been brought back from the dead.

### To The Cliffs

* Business at *the Scriptorium* completed, *the party* and *Balazar Lasa* went to *Balazar Lasa*'s house, where he wanted to gather some supplies.
  * Inside his mostly empty abode, he dug through a chest to find a small bag with three vials inside.
  * He handed them out to *Sennin* and *Armadyl*, and kept one himself.
  * Explained that, if needed, breaking the vial will release the power inside to improve their spellcasting.
  * *Sennin* looked a bit more closely, and determined that the mote of light within the vial was a distilled soul, but kept the information to himself.
* *Sennin* ritual cast water breathing on the group, while *Balazar Lasa* prepared his use of Teleport to bring everyone to the (poorly) described location.
* *The party* followed *Sennin* through the rough waters, luckily without major incident, and into the underwater cave and hidden cavern.

### That Fucking Skull

* Inside the resulting cavern, *Alenia Eldaloth* cast Detect Magic, eventually finding *The Skull Of Razaro* on the floor behind a statue.
* After a time and various individuals investigating the room, *the party* eventually figured out that *the skull* fits perfectly onto a pedestal and opens the far door further into this tunnel.
* Experimenting with it a bit, the group realized the door would automatically close if the skull was removed, or an amount of time passed.
* *Rivian* left *Beaks* with the pedestal, in case they needed to reopen the door or retrieve the skull, and the rest of *the party* went through into the next room.

### Lurking In The Dark

* In the next room, a large shallow pit of dark fog hung over the path forward.
* After reading a riddle that acted as a clue and experimenting with the fog a bit, *the party* discovered the apparent crystals would hold alight to keep the fog at bay for a short time.
* Proceeding strategically forward, the group encountered some aberrations in the fog, requiring a careful balance of progress and combat.
* Defeating these pursuers and crossing the pit, *the party* proceeded onward into another room.
* This next place, filled with cages, bones, and a winding path forward, contained another creature.
* With *Alenia Eldaloth*'s noting of the dissolution of the cage and bone and *Samantha Carter*'s quick reaction to notice it, the group avoided getting caught as a large black ooze dropped from the ceiling to attack.
