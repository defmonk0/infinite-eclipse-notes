### Necessary Sacrifice

* *The party* quickly finished off the Boneless that was carried through the portal with them before taking a look at the space around them.
  * A cathedral of bone in the distance was of note, where a short figure was seen bowing in the doorway before slipping inside.
* *The party* investigated the cavern, making sure there wasn't anything worrying set up on the outside.
  * *Sennin* sent his Manifest Mind inside to confirm numbers within.
* Eventually, regrouping, everyone head inside the cathedral.
* A conversation was held with *The Kin*, who were gathered up in a magic circle with a hostage.
  * Learned *Niefendil* is a shapeshifter, and has been acting as various people in the royal family and others to influence the succession and gain access to information.
  * *Artlaag* killed *their hostage*, activating the circle and removing them from the plane.
* *Balazar Lasa* and *Sennin* began inspecting the circle to learn how it works while others looted whatever was left in the cathedral.
* After figuring out that the soul vials could work to activate the circle, *Armadyl* released them and activated it, a trying moment for him.
* On the way out, *Armadyl* saw the slightest glimpse of something unusual about the interaction before the spell removed him from the space.

### A Safe Haven

* Having picked *Meriele Iranapha*'s tower as the destination for the magic circle's spell, *the party* appeared near the top of the mountain on which is rests.
* *Sennin* used Sending to inform *Prince Grund Caebrek* about his aunt's recent true identity.
* Everyone slipped inside the tower, and relaxed a bit around the long dining table on one of the floors of the tower.
  * Spoke of *Niefendil*'s identity as a changeling.
  * Identified the items pulled from the cathedral and distributed them.
* *B. B.* used Speak With Dead to talk to *the hostage* killed by *Artlaag*.
  * Learned little, as he seemed to be a passing bystander.
  * Got his name: *Hart Zech*.
  * *The Kin* didn't seem to get exactly what they were looking for, but still found something useful/interesting.
  * Described the item as a vial of desiccated worms.
* *Balazar Lasa* mentioned remembering something from ruins in the north mentioning such an item, and had briefly read about it while going through the material *Artlaag* was looking at before it was burned.
* *Meriele Iranapha* posed passing interest, asking *Balazar Lasa* about how concerning they were, before returning to her own business.
* After the conversations, everyone hunkered in for a night's rest.

### Return To *Machairi*

* In the morning, *the party* hitched a ride with *Balazar Lasa* back to *the scriptorium*.
* Everyone returned to *The Beaver & Mouse Inn* to have a chat.
  * Learned the rest of the information about the soul vials from *Balazar Lasa*, including their origin and why he had them.
    * Originally an experiment from a necromancer he and *Meriele Iranapha* had previously killed.
    * *Meriele Iranapha*, with a distaste for the more unnatural forms of necromancy, asked for them to be disposed of. 
    * *Balazar Lasa* secretly kept them to research how to possibly release them properly.
* *Balazar Lasa* began to head out, mentioning he'd be reaching out to contacts to try and pick up a trail on *The Kin* again.
  * Before departing, he realized he never turned over the information he learned about *the party*'s devil problem.
    * Public name of the Orthon is *Roqasca*.
    * *Halis* had returned some kind of artifact to an Archdevil of some power in the Bronze Citadel of Avernus.
    * Reward for this deed was significant money and access to making contracts with some of the more well connected devils there.
    * The contract itself was one for revenge, summoning one of their bounty hunters in the event of *Halis*'s death.

### A Broken Prince

* Completing their conversation, *the party* went back to the *Marthaag Royal Grounds* to meet with *the prince*.
  * Told him everything they knew of *Niefendil*.
  * News of his aunt definitely left him deflated.
  * Her study was left in disarray, and handed over a piece of paper left behind to see if *the party* could discern what it was.
    * *Armadyl* figured out pretty quickly that it was in the same format as the address they recently used while searching for *Kell Munggen*.
    * The system almost works like coordinates, so it points to a location somewhere within *Machairi*. 
    * *The party* quickly narrowed down to somewhere on the lake, northwest of the castle.
  * Asked *Prince Grund Caebrek* about any possible copies of the expedition information that was burned at *the scriptorium*.
    * Said he would look into it and get back to them.
* After leaving *the prince* to his grieving, *the party* head into the water, swimming to the location detailed on the sheet of paper.
  * There, underwater, they found the tied and hidden body of *Lady Arin Raga*.
