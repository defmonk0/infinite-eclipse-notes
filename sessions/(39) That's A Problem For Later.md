### Devils Don't Die When They Are Killed

* A fight with the summoned devil from the rune on *Halis*'s chest ensued. *Orb of magic bullshit*
  * It distracted with imps while moving invisibly around the battlefield.
  * *The party* made fairly quick work of the main fiend, but a few of his hits were quite scary.
  * Eventually, after bringing him close to the edge, he blew himself up vowing to meet again, sometime.
  * Realizing what had happened and that the devil would eventually return as part of the contract, *the party* decided little could be done at the moment and moved on.
* *The party* collected the rest of the items around the camp, including the drugs.
* Afterwards, *the party* started their walk back into *Ranafyll*.
  * Mid-way through the walk, a bat was noticed keeping pace in the sky.
  * Everyone stopped off briefly at a nearby tree, waiting to see what it would do.
  * Eventually, the bat came down to meet *the party*, and transformed into the familiar form of *Agnew Solidsgurd*.
  * He was just checking in on the results of their attack on *Halis*, and was told of the contract and complications.
  * After conversing, the group agreed to meet up with *Agnew Solidsgurd* the following day at sunset to begin the plan to take down *Morwenna Dusange*.
* Continuing onward toward *The Antumbral Aerie*, *the party* eventually returned to take a careful nights rest.

### Dawn Of The Final Day

* *The party* received a message from *Balazar Lasa*.
  * He confirmed the information sent by letter with *Prince Grund Caebrek*, and told *the party* to continue poking.
  * *Sennin* informed him of the extra information they learned of *Morwenna Dusange* and *Griswold Dusange*.
  * *Balazar Lasa* informed *the party* that it seems like *Artlaag* may be researching something at the *Machairi Grand Scriptorium & Library*, and would keep *the party* updated.
* *Infinite Eclipse* started researching the *Scorched War* in *the house*'s library to try and verify *Agnew Solidsgurd*'s story of how he was turned.
  * Would provide a backup plan with how to handle him in case things go sideways.
  * Eventually, by means of researching specifically *Varadi, The Crimson Inferno*, *the party* verified his story could be possible, but was unable to get an exact location other than a village on the outskirts of *Teorainn*.
* *Armadyl* passively mentioned to *Alenia Eldaloth* that the crown did come in handy during the fight with the fiends.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* completed *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell*'s trophy display.
  * It was a little wonky, but *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* didn't really notice.
* *B. B.* and *Alenia Eldaloth* had a conversation about how to cope with being away from family, and being homesick.
* *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* and *Sennin* made a trip to *Mischievous Eagle Alchemist* to buy some potions in preparation for the encounter with *Morwenna Dusange*.
* After a brief strategy meeting, *the party* departed west, towards the graveyard.

### Let's Go Kill A Vampire

* On the way, *Sennin* used Find Steed to summon a horse, *Nightshade*.
* Additionally, the group noted a bat flying towards the crypt as well, assuming it to be *Agnew Solidsgurd*.
* Upon arrival, *the party* set up outside the crypt and *Agnew Solidsgurd* arrived after a short bit.
* Entering the crypt, *Agnew Solidsgurd* led *the party* to a sarcophagus in the back of the room, removed the body, and stomped in the floor of it to reveal a pit.
  * *Agnew Solidsgurd* walked down the wall of the pit, while *the party* climbed down a rope.
  * The dimly lit cavern space that was descended into curved off off into the distance as was described.
  * Following the path, *the party* eventually found the resting ground, including the coffin on a table in the middle of the room.
* While discussing who would like to destroy the coffin, another bat flew down and perched upon it.
  * As *Agnew Solidsgurd* began to cautiously approach, the bat transformed and revealed to be *Morwenna Dusange*, awaiting them.
