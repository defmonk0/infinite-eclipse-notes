### Kobolds Are Just Lesser

* *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell*, tapping his blade and entering the cavern, starts initiative.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* and *B. B.* fucked around, blatantly not engaging in the combat.
* *Armadyl* did similarly, but was purposely missing to look like he was trying at least.
* Several people were attempting to be non-lethal, but then *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell*, *Ergan Ilukar*, and *Rivian* quickly stopped caring.
* *Sennin* went back to his old faithful of putting a bunch of them to sleep.
* *Ergan Ilukar* used his augmented fire breath to burn down several of them at once.
* After a couple rounds of combat, several *party* members could hear the beginnings of some rumblings in the caves, but couldn't pinpoint what or where it was.

### Big Worm

* The rumbling revealed itself to be a gargantuan Purple Worm, crashing through the wall near the entrance of the cavern and collapsing the floor out from beneath the entire engagement.
* Falling into a larger cavern below, several people took damage from the fall and collapsing rock.
* Picking themselves up, *the party* looked up to see several dead Kobolds among the massive worm and a few of what looked to be its offspring surrounding them.
* The fight starting anew, *the party* began to engage the worms.
* *Rivian* ended up swallowed by the worm, and *Sennin* battered to unconsciousness.
* Dying inside the stomach acids, *Alenia Eldaloth* used Aura of Life to continually keep *Rivian* alive.
* After *Sennin* was brought back up, the worm was polymorphed into an octopus to reduce it as a threat, and the change in size caused the worm to vomit up *Rivian*.
* As the children were taken care of, *the party* gathered around the transformed worm to prep a large onslaught of attacks to quickly kill it as well.

### Loot The Cavern & Leave

* *Sennin* began looking for the chests from above among the rubble, but instead found a bunch of gems among the rocks, compressed by the worms that eat the rock.
* *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* collected a baby worm head for his collection.
* *Armadyl* flew up to inspect the tunnel above before bringing everyone else up.
  * He found a lone surviving Kobold, who he managed to communicate with through some detect thoughts and hand signals.
  * Eventually, he convinced the Kobold to let *Armadyl* fly him across the gap to secure ground in the tunnel in the direction *the party* came from, saving him.
* Returning to *the party*, everyone took a short rest to be safe before flying or climbing back up to the tunnel above, continuing onward and out the other side of the cave.
