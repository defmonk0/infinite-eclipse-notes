### Who The Fuck Is *Balazar Lasa*, Anyway?

* Had a brief conversation of how the party is going to handle *Balazar Lasa* and *The Kin*.
* Left to go to the *Machairi Grand Scriptorium & Library* to ask *Ribble Silverthread* about *Balazar Lasa*.
* Learned that *Balazar Lasa*, at least to *Ribble Silverthread* seems a good person.
  * A little short tempered with people's stupidity.
  * A bit mischievous.
  * "If you trust me, he's about as trustworthy as I am."
* *Sennin* asked about how he figured out *Infinite Eclipse*'s real names.
  * *Ribble Silverthread* revealed that he likely used a detect thoughts spell, and does so often when meeting new people on the road for safety.
* After having this conversation, the party put in some requests for research at the front desk.
  * *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* asked about ship lines, icebreaker expeditions, and ports.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* asked about *The Ivory Oaks* (also known as, but not said, *In Berrel Bardyen*), other special trees of note throughout the continent, and the layout of the world as a whole.
  * *Sennin* asked about *The Battle For Machairi* during the *Scorched War*.
  * *Armadyl* asked for any information on *Black Buck*.
* The party left, and began walking back to the inn.

### Alenia Said She LIKED Crime

* An elvish woman, blonde, intercepted them.
  * Introduced herself as the individual *Infinite Eclipse* had been speaking to via the Sending Stone.
  * Asked to have a conversation, and led most of the party down the street to some seating at a cafe.
    * *Uklu* was already seated at the table, and was revealed to be the individual the party had following them.
  * Offered the party a job, delivering some amount of Suude, to a contact in *Mastow*.
    * Learned the contact will be a tortle named *Artlaag*.
    * Will give him the merchandise, and in return, can keep the bag.
    * If delivered at the earlier of two dates given, the reward will also include 2,000 gold.
  * *Sennin* used detect thoughts and determined, at least on surface value, that they were being straight-forward.
  * *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* suggested chartering a ship around the southern half of the continent, past *Kereskell* to drop off the currently-wanted *Balazar Lasa*, and continuing to *Mastow* to complete the job.
* The party agreed to the job, and then met back up at *The Beaver & Mouse Inn*.
* Informed *Alenia Eldaloth* of what was going on.

### I Swear This Isn't A Hentai

* *Infinite Eclipse* then made their way back to *The Stone Pit* so *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* could have a battle with *Colm Rolen*.
  * No betting was done other than the initial wager.
  * It was an intense fight, but *Colm Rolen* took the win handily after getting into his groove.
  * *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* had a drink at the bar, where *Zimi* came to commiserate and drink as well.
* At the end of the night, the party once again returned to *The Beaver & Mouse Inn* for the night.

### That Toad Was Being Indignant

* The next morning, the group picked up *Chestnut* and made their way north toward *The Beast's Basin*.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* handed out Elixirs Of Health to *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* and *Ergan Ilukar*, for future use.
* The party, after learning how a Bag Of Holding works, confirmed at least one vial of Suude is contained in the bag.
* *Sennin* cast Arcane Lock on the bag, supplying the party as an allow-list and a password of 'correct horse battery staple'.
* *Armadyl* noticed footprints of a group heading north-east.
  * Did a bit of investigating of a dinosaur corpse to determine it was likely to be some Hobgoblins.
* Ignored that possible encounter, and continued on to *The Beast's Basin*.
* *Infinite Eclipse* found a Giant Frog and Giant Toad, as was the goal, losing a couple javelin's from *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* in the process.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* said she'd buy him new ones.
* Found a place to camp, and had a surprisingly (fucking dice) quiet night.

# *367-6-6*

### That Was Too Easy

* *Infinite Eclipse* packed up camp and headed back towards *Machairi*.
* *Alenia Eldaloth*, keeping an eye out for additional animals, saw and Ape that could be used for wildshape.
* As the party exited the forest, the session ended...with no combat...goddammit.
