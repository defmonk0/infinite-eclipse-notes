### *Armadyl* & *B. B.* Drinking In The Panic Closet

* *Alenia Eldaloth* responds to *B. B.*'s sending:
  * "I am home. Also, that sounds neither surprising, nor urgent."
* *Sennin* informed *Berric* about his order for a sapphire from *Selma*, and gave him the money to pay for it when it arrives just in case *the party* has left town by then.
* Later on in the day, *B. B.* uses Sending once again, continuing to push *Alenia Eldaloth* to return, using the revelations about *Niefendil* and *Berric* to emphasize the situation.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* simply replies "... Fuck."
  * Continuing to lose it, *B. B.* now devolves into spending time in her closet, dubbed, '*The Panic Closet*'.
* *Armadyl* finds *B. B.* in her panic closet after looking around for her, and requests the use of her holy symbol to *Isdaima*.
  * *B. B.* agrees, but only if he does whatever he plans to do there in the closet with her.
  * *Armadyl* agrees, and uses Commune to contact *Isdaima*.
    * Have you ever instructed someone to do something on your behalf?
      * "Never instructed, but have made requests".
    * Have those requests ever regarded doing something to an animal?
      * Confused, and maybe a little ashamed: "Yes".
    * Did you ever request that a young boy have an animal mutilated?
      * A firm "No".
  * The spell ending and the pendant returned, *B. B.* asks if *Armadyl* got what he wanted.
    * He didn't get exactly what he needed, but it was at least some sort of progress.
  * *B. B.* then starts to explain how poorly she's handling *Alenia Eldaloth*'s disappearance, and asks *Armadyl* to get her wine.
    * *Armadyl* agrees, and fetches a bottle and two glasses to join her, drinking in *The Panic Closet*.

### Why Was This So Hard Last Time?

* Meanwhile, *Mytejager* is wrapping up at *Hlavar-Jufa Keep*, inquiring about *Agnew Solidsgurd*'s business in *Caldur*.
  * The reception explains that he was requested to assist *Prince Grund Caebrek* with things there, and they're likely staying at *Mourning Dew Keep*.
* Moving on, *Mytejager* then heads into town to visit the bar *the party* first staked out as part of the drug investigations in search of *Black Buck*.
  * Going right to the barkeep, *Mytejager* places a vial of *White Flake* on the bar and says he needs more.
  * The barkeep starts to freak out a bit, realizing what it was, and informs *Mytejager* that he simply used to rent out the back room to the group peddling the stuff.
    * They left and moved on some months ago after something happened back there.
  * After a bit more prodding, the barkeep directs *Mytejager* towards an alley a few blocks away where he might find a seller, and learns the drug's name.
* Going to the directed alley, *Mytejager* finds it comically easy to purchase both *White Flake* and *Devil Weed* from an individual there.
  * He then also manages to sell Red *Suude* back to the dealer, who happily adds it to his stock since they've been struggling to find supply.
  * During this, *Mytejager* discovers the individual is a newly turned vampire, and very poor at hiding it.
* Finally, *Mytejager* goes to a bar to fill the mini-keg before returning to the mansion.

### Just Another Tool

* Nearing early evening, *Alenia Eldaloth* returns to *Aethia* proper from the patrol she joined *Theren Sylvaranth* on.
* Arriving at the temple, *Alenia Eldaloth* psyches herself up and enters, finding *Elwin Horineth* and the font of holy water she needs.
  * Surprised at *Alenia Eldaloth*'s presence, *Elwin Horineth* agrees to allow her use of the font for her Scrying purposes, also noting that she thought *Drusila Ariessus* was the only one in *Aethia* capable of that.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* first uses Scrying on *Artlaag*, who she finds passing the time in a [familiar abandoned farmhouse](03.%20The%20Kin\%2821%29%20That%20Was%20A%20Long%20Fight.md) outside of *Mastow*.
  * Then, trying *Niefendil* in his natural form, the Scrying fails.
* Grumbling about that failure and pondering what to do, *Elwin Horineth* notices and reminds her that *Drusila Ariessus* can also attempt to Scry for her if she needed more.
  * Finding *Drusila Ariessus*, *Alenia Eldaloth* requests her join in on the Scrying and *Drusila Ariessus* agrees.
  * Returning to the temple once again, *Drusila Ariessus* attempts to Scry on *Uklu*, making use of the drawing.
    * It fails, but *Drusila Ariessus* is fairly certain he resisted the effects, and is alive.
  * Finally, *Drusila Ariessus* also uses Scrying on *Armadyl*, making use of a feather from *Alenia Eldaloth*.
    * Successful, she describes a scene of *Armadyl* and *B. B.*, sipping from glasses as they share a bottle of wine in a small darkened closet.
  * Noting it looked like *B. B.* was having a hard time, *Drusila Ariessus* gave a present for her to *Alenia Eldaloth*, saying it might remind her of home.
    * Deciding that might be a decent idea, *Alenia Eldaloth* also is sure to get a keg of fruit wine for her as well.
* *Alenia Eldaloth*, deciding that scene was finally call for enough concern, says her goodbyes to family and friends and, just before dinner, opens a portal through the back of her familial home to return to *Ranafyll* as *Drusila Ariessus* watches excitedly.

### Awkward Family Dinner

* Returning to *the house*, *Berric* is calling out to everyone present that dinner was served, gathering everyone at the table before preparing to head out for a date night.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* apologizes to everyone for taking off so suddenly, and gives *B. B.* her gift from *Drusila Ariessus* and keg of wine.
  * *Mytejager*, immediately disappointed, notes he'll keep his keg for later use.
* Settling in for their meal, *the party* catches *Alenia Eldaloth* up on the various information that has come out since she left about *The Kin* and everything else from the Zone of Truth.
  * During this, *Alenia Eldaloth* also notes that *Meriele Iranapha* said she saw two kobolds leaving *Arahaam* early that morning.
  * *Mytejager* informs everyone about *Agnew Solidsgurd*'s trip to *Caldur*.
* Eventually, *the party* discusses next steps, deciding it best to return the bodies of *Teng* and *Terkol Liongaze* to *Teorainn* before heading either to *Mastow* or directly to *Caldur*.
* *Armadyl* tosses his gift, a potion of growth, to *Mytejager*, which he begrudgingly accepts before *the party* splits up, finished eating.
* Clearing up dinner, *the party* then places the body of *Terkol Liongaze* on the table to cast Speak With Dead.
  * What did your previous interrogators wish to know?
    * Due to the nature of the spell, the body does not know.
  * What did you know about *the Maw*?
    * "A holy place. Some sort of government secrets there."
  * What god did you follow?
    * "Praise *The Tormented*; suffering cleanse the soul."
  * What private information do you have that someone might kill you over?
    * "I've survived while wanted for many decades. Many would have me put to death for any of it."
  * Did you do anything with the portal in the *Crypt of Kinzaas' Folly* south of *Machairi*?
    * "It was a relic from the war; one we wished to use to search for our holy guide. We wished to return him to cleanse the traitors."

### Chores

* With everyone preparing to go their own ways after dinner, *Mytejager* theorized, based on the new vampire that he met today, that *Agnew Solidsgurd* might be attempting to turn *the prince* into a vampire.
  * *The party* mostly brushes this off, but *Armadyl* uses Sending to ask *the prince* if he is a vampire.
    * Very confused, *the prince* simply responds "No?".
* After everyone else leaves, *Ergan Ilukar* begins interrogating his patron through his sword.
  * Asking why the patron wishes he make his way to *Caldur*, it is explained that the patron may have a job for *Ergan Ilukar* to do while there.
  * *Ergan Ilukar* then presses for details, and the patron simply says that 'something needs burning'.
  * Continuing to push, *Ergan Ilukar* gets a massive migraine, putting an end to the questioning.
* *Sennin* makes his way to *B. B.*'s panic closet, passing by her in the room on the way there.
  * He settles in, closes the door, and successfully casts Contact Other Plane to speak with *Laikrodis*.
    * Is it possible for *Niefendil* to achieve his goal of becoming a god?
      * "Yes."
    * What will the consequences be if this happens?
      * "Unclear."
    * Do the gods have a means of preventing it from happening.
      * "Our influence through followers is both far-reaching and limited."
    * Is there a way for *us* to prevent it from happening?
      * "Yes."
      * *Sennin* ponders the idea of killing *Niefendil*, and the answer is expanded, almost as if in response: "There are many options."
    * Are we the ones to prevent it from happening?
      * "That...is up to you."
  * Finishing up his spell, *Sennin* gets up, exits the closet, waves as he walks past *B. B.* once again, and leaves.
* *Armadyl* is searching over *Terkol Liongaze*'s body for any insignia relevant to *Kinzaas*.
  * He does eventually find a tattoo depicting a symbol of him on his hip, and *Armadyl* uses that to then cast Commune once again, this time to *Kinzaas*.
    * Did you ask a child, specifically an orphan in *Arahaam*, to kill or mutilate an animal for you?
      * "No."
    * Do you reside within The Abyss?
      * "No."
    * Would you welcome this sort of connection again?
      * Amused: "Sure."
  * Then, casting commune again, he contacts *Mharu*.
    * It was you, wasn't it?
      * Laughing: "Oh yes."
    * Did you intend for this turn of events?
      * "No."
    * Did *Leighas* kill you?
      * Oddly serious and solemn, to the point of seeming out of character: "Yes."
* *Alenia Eldaloth*, in the greenhouse, is attempting to make a healing potion.
  * It fails, but she discovers that her wrist had been itchy because it seems that *Sapientia's Lunar Wristlet* has evolved, growing vines from it.
  * Running to excitedly tell *Armadyl* about it and finding him as his communes finish, she shows him her new capability to use grasping vine.
    * Noting she doesn't feel and distance to her faith, *Alenia Eldaloth* is informed that *Armadyl* has something to speak to her about on that, but that it should wait until another time since it was getting late.
* *Armadyl* then turns invisible and goes searching for *Mytejager*, finding him seated and taking watch on the roof.
  * Foregoing his original plans to take back the potion, *Armadyl* plops down on the ground next to him and drops his spell.
  * They begin discussing *Armadyl*'s choices and actions, and *Mytejager* asks if, given the chance, *Armadyl* could kill *him*.
    * *Armadyl* understands that *Niefendil* must die, but doesn't know that he can do it himself.
* Pondering the strength needed to follow through, *Mytejager* ends his watch requesting *Armadyl* send *Ergan Ilukar* up, but *Armadyl* notes he'll do it instead; *Mytejager* agrees and heads to bed.
