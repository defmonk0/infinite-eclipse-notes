### Paranoia's A Bitch

* Florian, Armadyl, and Alenia cross the river, while the remaining party continued on the eastern side.

  * *Beaks* did find and note a group of individuals camping on the eastern side though.
  * They informed the rest of the group, and they decided to give it a shot.
* *Infinite Eclipse* ended up camping for the night with the group of guards who were simply mid-travel back to *Machairi* themselves.

* In the morning, *Sennin* had a beard by nature of his new belt.
* *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* and *Ergan Ilukar* went to *Vanchu's Anvil* to work on the new weapon.

  * Learned of Spellwrought Tattoos as the likely culprit for the individual casting using them in the mausoleum.

* *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* talked to *Nagre* about *Black Buck*'s hand in the alcohol trade.
