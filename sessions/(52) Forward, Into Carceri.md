### Black Ooze

* Combat initiated with the Black Pudding, with victory coming to *the party* after a short bit.
* Luckily, only minimal damage was brought upon *the party*'s equipment; most notably, *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell*'s new hammer was badly damaged but fixed after a few minutes in *Balazar Lasa*'s hands via Mending.
* Similar to the last, *the party* pushed onward into the next room.

### An Unsettling Space

* This space, a seeming torture chamber, was found to have a few things that stood out:
  * What seemed to be an archway that acted as a portal, similar to the one previously found in the *Crypt of Kinzaas' Folly*, though with a different method of activation.
  * A series of fiendish statues on the side walls, each holding and presenting a rusted skull in their hands and a riddle above their heads.
* Determining the skulls might function similar to the stones used to bind the Flind that *the party* had previously encountered, everyone set up in four groups around the room.
  * All four groups had a spellcaster expend a spell simultaneously, with the power being absorbed as assumed.
  * The skulls all began to alight, but more power was still needed.
  * As the first magic power was offered, a large number of undead Boneless began to slip through the floor and attack *the party*.

### Through The Portal

* Eventually supplying enough power to all the skulls while fighting off the undead, the portal lit up and *the party* regrouped.
* *Sennin* and *Balazar Lasa* began to attempt to determine more about the nature of this portal, determining it led to Carceri, the model for all prisons, and a plane that makes normal escape quite difficult.
* There seemed to be no end to the coming monsters, so, seeing no other choice, *Sennin* made the decision and went through the portal.
  * The rest of the party soon followed, careful to leave no one behind.
  * *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* carried *Samantha Carter* and one of these undead into the portal.
