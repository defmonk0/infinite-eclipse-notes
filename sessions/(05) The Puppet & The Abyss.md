### Wrapping Up At The Inn

* Relaxing at the Inn, the group considered leaving the shop alone, and just going after the goblin contract that *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* and *Ergan Ilukar* received.
* Decided to check it out anyway.
* *Infinite Eclipse* prepared to make their way over to *Tick Tock Clock Stock*, and waited for nightfall.

### Sneaky, Sneaky

* A few of the group made their way into the shop with the assistance of *Alenia Eldaloth*'s spell.
* An investigation found books about The Abyssal Plane, Transmutation, and Necromancy.
* Nothing of note was found until they discovered an old key in a secret desk compartment.
* This key opened a metal cage door behind a bookshelf in the same room, where they found *Armadyl* chained up.
* They helped him out, asked some basic questions, and gathered the rest of their party.
* They then ventured into the hidden basement, where they engaged the [Clockwork Assassin](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/1777893-clockwork-assassin-puppet) that *Gilian Edmur* was working on.
* During the fight, they broke a crystal ball that seemed linked to The Abyss, and was healing the construct.

### Search & Leave

* An investigation of the basement found a series of encoded notes, a cipher, and a letter to *Gilian Edmur*, asking for the construct.
* Additionally, a chest contained a decent chunk of money.
* A brief discussion was had to keep *Armadyl* around, and the group made their way back to *The Stone Brick Inn* to further convene and talk about what they found.
