### Roll Initiative

* *Infinite Eclipse* quickly began engaging the Flind and the other Gnolls in the room, starting off with a bang via some dynamite from *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell*.
* *Armadyl*, *Alenia Eldaloth*, *Sennin*, and *Florian* set off around the room pumping spell slots into the crystals.
* Eventually, *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* was hit by the Flind's Flail of Madness.
  * This caused him to go after *Artlaag*, who used a spell in reaction when his hit points started to get low.
  * This immediately knocked out *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* to stop the onslaught.
* Alenia brought *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* back up, and eventually, all the crystals were destroyed and the Flind faded away.
* The remaining Gnolls were then finished off.

### It's Almost The Tortle's Bed Time

* *Sennin* started studying after the end of the evening.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* noted the crystals were just a common arcane focus, and not anything special.
* A work desk and bookshelf contained some basic information about their location and two books.
  * *Artlaag* mentioned one was cursed, and outlined the ritual used to bind the Flind.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* promptly burned that one, and kept the other empty notebook for herself.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* started collecting bits of wood from the overturned chairs and tables for later use.
* Continuing to ask about the ritual itself, *Artlaag* revealed the name of *Niefendil*, the individual who was disguised as the elvish woman the party met in *Machairi*.
* *Armadyl* asked about why they were following *Kinzaas, The Tormented* in particular.
  * Revealed it was out of convenience; it's the most obvious trail left to investigate and the cult following him was without leadership and could be used in the process.
* Conversed about the fate of the other gods.
  * Why would they leave?
    * Maybe to avoid interfering any further.
  * Why are you searching for them?
    * For the love of history, and has been researching them for 40 years (Tortles reach adulthood at around 15, and only live to be about 15, so *Artlaag* is quite old).
* *Artlaag* will be heading to *Kereskell* after this to meet up with *Niefendil* and *Uklu*.
  * Told there may be another job for them if they're interested while passing through *Argelen*.
  * *Niefendil* would contact them via the sending stone some time after they split up.
* *Artlaag* went to sleep, so the rest of the party started to discuss what they wanted to do with their relationship with *The Kin*.
* Eventually, the rest of the party also went to sleep.

### D&D Players Dream Of Smug Gods

* Dream sequence played out as described in *Dream Sequence After Flind*.
* At the end, *Armadyl*, *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell*, and *Ergan Ilukar* all got access to some new expanded powers.
* They eventually asked *Birkoziik, The Steadfast* if *The Kin* were his enemy.
  * Responded that wasn't exactly the case.
  * Also mentioned that *Artlaag* is a follower of *Laikrodis, The Inquisitor*.
* They all woke up, and talked about the experience and figured out their powers.
* Eventually, going back to sleep, the session ended.
