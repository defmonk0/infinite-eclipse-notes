### Let's Get Some Rest

* After the fight with the [Roc](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/roc), *the party* took a short rest.
  * *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* salvaged some feathers and talons from the bird.
* For the remaining couple hours of travel, the group continued east out of the mountains.
* Reaching the very edge of the range and trees and the base, *Infinite Eclipse* decided to sleep for the night.

### Or Not

* During the second watch, some rustling was noticed in the nearby bushes and trees.
* A group of [Bugbears](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/bugbear) emerged, and demanded food.
* After a few failed intimidation and charming attempts, a fight broke out.
* A very long fight ensued, with much of the tactics centered around flanking wherever possible for advantage.
* The bugbear chief was brought back up twice via potions.
* Eventually, *the party* enacted a no survivors plan, and eliminated all fleeing enemies.
* Afterward, after calming down from the adrenaline, *the party* returned to sleep for the evening.

### Uneventful Travel

* The next day was mostly travel across the plains in the valley towards *Mastow*.
* Nothing of note decided to bother *the party*, and the travel wasn't on a main road, so there were no other travelers.
* Another night of rest was taken camping just a few hours out of town.

### The Return To *Mastow*

* Arrived in town around noon.
* Made a quick trip to *Aedwin's Abandoned House*.
  * Thought it could be a good option for a meeting place to drop off the drugs.
  * The house was completely missing, an empty lot in its place.
* Went to the *The Cracked Mug* to set up there until contacting *The Kin*.
  * Saw *Nielas Cotte*, who was still running bar.
  * *Infinite Eclipse* was informed he was engaged.
  * Contacted *The Kin* via sending stone, and told *Artlaag* will meet them at *The Cracked Mug* shortly.
  * On his arrival, he took *the party* outside to inform him of a meeting place at an old farm outside town, and to meet there in 2 hours.

### *Infinite Eclipse* Is Paranoid AF

* *Infinite Eclipse* decided to scope out the drop-off point ahead of time.
* Snuck up to the farm, checking the barn, field, and farmhouse for any traps or ambushes best as possible.
* Nothing of note was found, so everyone eventually grouped back up closer to the actual meeting time.

### We Drug Mules Now

* Upon arrival, *Artlaag* was present with a half-orc man and a cart.
* The money and goods were traded, and the *suude* was loaded onto the cart and taken away by the half-orc.
* *Artlaag* began explaining that they have another job for *the party*, if they're interested.
* The session ended on that cliffhanger.
