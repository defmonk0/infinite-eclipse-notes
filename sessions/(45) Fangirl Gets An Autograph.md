# *367-10-5*

### Morning Shopping

* Everyone awoke and met up to have breakfast.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* waited outside *Tethren Ignominy*'s door as a cat, could hear him taking breakfast in his room, and gave up on messing with him.
  * Discussed plans and options for the to-do list of the day.
  * *Sennin* stayed behind for the day to work on a Feather Falling scroll for *Rivian* to replace the one he used.
* *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* decided some shopping was in order, so *the party* went to *Thistle Do Nicely* to buy some potions.
* *The party* went to the *Machairi Grand Scriptorium & Library* to meet up with *Balazar Lasa* to ask if he knew where they could find *Ki'yorl Nirinath*.
  * *Balazar Lasa* suggested the *Marthaag Royal Grounds*, as guests are offered a place to stay there.
  * He also found it strange that *Tethren Ignominy* would stay at a regular inn rather than someone on the grounds.
  * *Balazar Lasa* set up and took a teleportation circle to *Meriele Iranapha*'s tower to start looking into *the party*'s devil problem.

### A Visit To *Ki'yorl*

* *The party* made their way over to the *Marthaag Royal Grounds*.
  * A checkpoint was posted outside as part of the heightened security of the city.
  * After brief distraction of a child's prank, *the party* requested to meet with *Ki'yorl Nirinath* and a letter was run in to him.
* While waiting for a response, hoping *Ki'yorl Nirinath* was available on short notice, *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* made a quick trip to *Vanchu's Anvil*.
  * Left behind his dinosaur head to have it preserved.
  * Bought a war hammer for use when he only has one hand free.
* A bit after *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* returned, *the party* was granted access to visit with *Ki'yorl Nirinath*.
  * Led in by a guard to *Ki'yorl Nirinath*'s room.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* got her copy of *Instructional Writings On Potions of Healing* signed after some pleasantries.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* used Detect Magic to check if there was any magical instances of 3rd parties listening in.
  * *The party* informed *Ki'yorl Nirinath* of *Tethren Ignominy*'s stay at *The Beaver & Mouse Inn*.
    * Also found it strange, though *Tethren Ignominy* was due to attend a dinner with the other candidates that evening.
  * *Ki'yorl Nirinath* was also informed of what they had learned of *the prince's uncle*.
    * Warned him they had no solid proof yet, but were working on it.
    * He was very concerned, but also intrigued by the possibility of removing a competitor.
  * *Ki'yorl Nirinath* requested *the party*'s assistance with convincing *Prince Grund Caebrek* to abandon slavery.
  * Also informed him of *Lady Arin Raga* being the one to sign the research writ of *Artlaag*.
* On the way out, *the party* requested their meeting with *Prince Grund Caebrek* as well, but left afterward since that one would likely take time.

### Where The Fuck Is *Zimi*

* *The party* checked in on *Sennin*, and spent some time deciding where you go next.
  * Also tried to check in on *Tethren Ignominy* again, but he wasn't there.
* Decided to use Sending to ask *Zimi* where she was, and was told the *Upper Trenches*.
* *The party* minus *Sennin* made their way over to that district, and realized they should have been more specific about where to meet her.
  * Assuming she was here to siege another hideout of *The Ruby Lash*, *Rivian* sent *Beaks* up to search for signs of combat.
  * Finding something a bit off from their location, *Beaks* directed *the party* there, where two individuals were discovered bleeding out on the floor of an alley.
  * One died while *the party* was deciding what to do, but the other was healed and brought back to consciousness.
  * Terrified and stressed, *the party* interrogated the man but he didn't know anything of what they were asking.
* Letting him go and standing around deciding how to proceed, *Zimi* eventually snuck up behind the group in the alley saying they stood out like a sore thumb.
* *The party* was led to a secret underground bar to talk about whatever they needed.
