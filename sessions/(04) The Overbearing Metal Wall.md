### Battle With Bandits

* *Infinite Eclipse* prepared camp for the night.
* They didn't light a fire in an attempt to stay less noticeable from the hobgoblin raid they learned of from *Chestnut*.
* They set up watches, and noticed them being approached by a gang of bandits attempting to attack them in their sleep.
* The bandits were mostly dispatched and looted (*Ergan Ilukar* was knocked unconscious), with *two bandits* being taken hostage.
* The group tied the *two bandits* up and went back to sleep.

### The Last Leg Of The Trip

* The surviving bandits agreed to lead *Infinite Eclipse* to their hidden stash.
* Upon finding the stash, more gold and supplies were gained.
* The *two bandits* were stripped of anything dangerous and let free to head south.
* *Infinite Eclipse* arrived in *Caldur* and went to *Tick Tock Clock Stock* to scope it out, determining it was a job better suited for night time.

### The Muddy Mess Of *Caldur*

* *Infinite Eclipse* split up to take care of various things throughout the city.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* went to a bookstore and got a book, *Burning Lands - A History of Conflict in Semoor*.
* *Ergan Ilukar* and *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* went to the local guards and received a writ to pass through the gates along with a job to clear out a goblin encampment near the north side of the *Caldur* Peaks. There was also a job to clear out some kind of Giant in the *Aethian Crag* to the east.
* *Florian* got himself a room at the *The Stone Brick Inn*, and bought some new clothes while looking for studded leather armor.
* *Samantha Carter* split up some of his excess rations, and asked around about a weapon shop, learning of *Caldur Steel*.
* *Sennin* simply head to *The Stone Brick Inn*, relaxing and staying out of sight.

### A Covert Operation

* *Infinite Eclipse* regrouped at *The Stone Brick Inn*, and decided to wait for nightfall and send a reduced party to *Tick Tock Clock Stock* on a covert mission.
