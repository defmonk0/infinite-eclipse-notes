### The Stake-Out

* A few hours in, the party spotted a man pulling a cart coming toward the tavern/alley they had been watching.
* *Florian* sent *Beaks* to distract the Tiefling at the front of the alley.
* *Armadyl* approached the cart.
* Using the suggestion spell, *Armadyl* suggested the man just go home and took the cart.
* *Florian* disguised himself using his as as the man pulling the cart.
* *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* went off to follow the man home.
* *Florian* delivered the cart and got some basic information about the layout of the alley, their defenses, and their delivery frequency, and that this location was just a selling point.
* *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* tried really hard to interrogate the man, but he REALLY wanted to go home.
  * Eventually, he arrived at his house and just asked his questions there.
  * Learned the location where the man does his pickups.
* *Florian* got a date with a Halfling among the drug dealers.
* Everyone met back up and exchanged information on the way back to *The Monkeyâ€™s Belt* to sleep for the night.

### Investigate The Cemetery

* In the morning, *Infinite Eclipse* set out to investigate the pickup location for the drug cart, a cemetery a few miles out of the city.
* On the way, *Samantha Carter* realized the party was being followed.
  * Using hold person, the party captured the individual who turned out to be the Halfling woman from the night before.
  * Questioned her, learning she was hired to follow them after their endeavors the previous night, but didn't know much more.
  * Decided she would die anyway, and pulled a hidden blade on *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell*, who ended up decapitating her.
  * No date for *Florian*.
* Arriving at the cemetery, the party found a large mausoleum at the back.
  * *Florian* tried picking the lock to open it, and he lost his tools but got the door open.
  * *Sennin* gave him his as a replacement.
  * Investigating the sarcophagi, the party found it was a mixed bag of names. A few they read included:
    * Solidsgurd
      * Recognized that someone on the *Ranafyll City Council* (*Agnew Solidsgurd*) has that last name.
    * Drouais
    * Lanco
    * Gwemonds
      * Recognized that someone on the *Ranafyll City Council* (*Aureann Gwemonds*) has that last name.
  * An alter similar to the one in the basement of *Tick Tock Clock Stock* was located in the rear of the main chamber.
  * *Armadyl* and *Alenia Eldaloth* made sure to go recover and hide/bury the body of the Halfling so it wasn't discovered by anyone on the path to the cemetery.
  * *Florian* tried to re-lock the door to hide the fact that they were inside, but simply broke another set of picks.

### Ambush Them!

* *Infinite Eclipse* simply waited for day for evening to come, and around 9pm someone was approaching.
* *Beaks* spotted them and let the party know 2 figured were approaching.
* A few people cast spells in preparation for the encounter.
