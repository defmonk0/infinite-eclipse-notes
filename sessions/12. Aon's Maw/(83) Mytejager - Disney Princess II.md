### Giants In The Morning

* As the engagement begins, the axe used by the giant alights with runic magic, dispelling Tiny Hut as it crashes down upon it again.
* *Sennin* uses his Draconic Spirit spell for the first time, summoning *Kulika* to join the fight, engaging the giant from above.
* An additional creature, a Remorhaz, erupts from the ground behind *the party*, pincering them.
* *Mytejager* becomes double big, using his regular growth in addition to a potion.
* *Ergan Ilukar* hears a voice encouraging him to use his fire breath, and keeps his mind steady enough to move into position to avoid hitting anyone else in *the party*.
* *Ergan Ilukar* and *Mytejager* get the final blows on the giant, simultaneously cutting off both of its heads.
* *The party*, trying to avoid getting close to the Remorhaz, pops around the battlefield and quickly focuses the beast to take it down.
* Eventually, *Samantha Carter* gets the killing blow, landing an arrow between its eyes while invisible.

### Preparation & Progress

* Given the early morning engagement, *the party* sets up for a short rest before setting out for the day.
* *Mytejager* collects some of the colored spikes from the Remorhaz.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* collects the sapling that has sprouted from the giant.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* uses some of her *Dried Aethic Herbs* to patch up *Samantha Carter* during the short rest.
* *Armadyl* asks *B. B.* to try Speak With Dead on *Terkol Liongaze*'s body again, but it is still unsuccessful.
* *Mytejager* collects both giant heads and inspects the creature's axe.
  * It is noted that the axe is magical, so *Sennin* casts identify and learns that it requires attunement.
  * *B. B.* attunes to it even though she is not proficient, resizing the axe to be a more reasonable size.
  * *The party* discusses some possible basic training sessions between her and *Mytejager* to teach her to use the martial weapon.
* *Mytejager* and *Alenia Eldaloth* inquire if *Sennin*'s dragon is rideable. 
  * He reveals it should be given proper equipment, though it might be a bit more difficult for the larger *Mytejager*.
* Finishing up their rest, *the party* continues progressing toward *Aon's Maw*, only inconvenienced in visibility by the weather.
* Near the end of the day, *the party* hears the howling of wolves far in the distance, but continue on, ignoring them.

### Wolves In The Night

* Setting up Tiny Hut at the end of the day's travel, *the party* settles in for their night's rest.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* used Druidcraft to predict the weather once again, learning it would be quite clear the next day.
* Some time in the night, *Armadyl* hears yelping and footsteps; some sort of creatures approaching the dome and eventually sees they are a pack of wolves.
  * *Mytejager* gathers some of the Remorhaz meat he had taken and offers it up to them while the rest of *the party* watches from within the dome.
    * *Samantha Carter*'s Goodberries are also gathered, given, and quickly consumed.
  * The largest of the wolves actually begins to speak with him, with the others soon following suit in a mixture of common and giant.
  * They come to an agreement for the wolves to search out *Niefendil* in return for additional food, offering his scent on the various items *the party* has acquired over time.
  * While wrapping up and returning to bed, *Alenia Eldaloth* and *Mytejager* discuss the foolishness of keeping the Sending Stone out of the Bag of Holding, allowing it to be traceable.
  * *Mytejager* secretly stashes the Sending Stone instead of returning it to the Bag of Holding like he claimed he would.

### A Scent On The Wind

* Morning comes, and *the party* begins to rise and finds the wolves are already awaiting them outside the dome.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* and *Samantha Carter* both cast Goodberry as additional food to uphold their end of the bargain, noting they will only be good for a day.
  * The wolves gladly accept the abundance of food, stating they would be sure to return them to the nest before nightfall.
  * *Ergan Ilukar* also offers some alcohol from his flask, and the largest wolf partakes though was taken aback by the strange feelings caused by the liquid.
* The wolves then explain that they did in fact find the scent *the party* was looking for, stating they had followed it on the wind no more than a days travel southwest of their current location.
