### False Positive

* *Alenia Eldaloth* leads *the party* northward through the blizzard while maintaining her Locate Creature spell, but gets no response while looking for a half-orc *Niefendil*.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* receives a Sending from *Meriele Iranapha* stating: 
  * "As an update - you were asleep. I've been here for hours. If a Tortle approaches these city gates, it will no longer be among the living." - *Meriele Iranapha*
  * "I will let you know if I find any significant changes. *Mytejager* says keep the shell and skull please." - *Alenia Eldaloth*
* Continuing northward with little else, *the party* breaks for lunch and *Alenia Eldaloth* casts Commune With Nature.
  * Feeling a deep cold pit in the bottom of her stomach, she senses a powerful fey presence slightly off *the party*'s current course in the direction they are headed.
  * No influence from other planes.
  * Giant varieties of wildlife do pass through this area, but there are none within 3 miles at the time of casting.
* Informing the rest of *the party* of the powerful fey, everyone continued in that direction with *Alenia Eldaloth* once again casting Locate Creature.
  * *Armadyl* eventually notices a silhouette rustling in the snow in the distance.
  * *Armadyl* casts detect thoughts with extended range, and learns there are three creatures focused on eating an elk ahead of them.
  * *Ergan Ilukar* uses his armor to pass into the Ethereal plane and approaches from there to scope out the creatures.
    * He finds three individuals who are determined to be some kind of hags after he returns to describe them to the rest of *the party*.
  * Deciding it wasn't worth the danger of interacting with them, *the party* used Pass Without A Trace (along with *B. B.* using Blessing of the Trickster on the exhausted *Armadyl*) to successfully skirt around them and return to their original heading unnoticed.

### All The Magic

* Continuing traveling for the rest of the day, *the party* eventually comes to stop to rest for the evening and *Sennin* sets up Tiny Hut.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* casts Druidcraft to predict the weather, learning the next day should be sunny and clear.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* also attempts to use Scrying on *Niefendil*, but the spell is entirely blocked by something.
* Frustrated, *Alenia Eldaloth* then casts Scrying on *Artlaag* and finds him hunting in a forest, seemingly not far from where he was seen the previous night.
  * After some brief discussion about it, *Alenia Eldaloth* realizes that he would be quite far from that same place if he was actually traveling towards *Arahaam* with any haste.
  * Worried, *Alenia Eldaloth* then messages *Thamior Caphaxath* to warn them of his and *Meriele Iranapha*'s possible proximity to *Aethia*.
    * "Heighten security at border. Trust no one until identity verified. Meriele might be hunting in the neighborhood. Be nice to her."
    * "I would be nothing but the upmost gentleman with her. But, her involvement does prompt concern. It will be done."
  * Then, *Alenia Eldaloth* asks *B. B.* to send to *Meriele Iranapha*.
    * "*Artlaag* in forest- either *Aethia* or Eastwood. Not taking the path we originally thought. *Aethia* has been warned. Will update as need. Love you, bye."
    * "Ha! Well, the goal was to stop him from attacking someone here, right? Can't do that if I'm here. BURRRRP."
* *Armadyl* thanked *B. B.* for her earlier blessing, and asks to borrow her holy symbol to reach out to *Isdaima, The Mischievous*.
  * *B. B.* is skeptical, but agrees after making him pinky promise to return it.
  * *Armadyl* then casts Commune, reaching out to *Isdaima*.
    * Do you know of a changeling follower of yours who goes by the name *Niefendil*?
      * Yes.
    * I understand the nature of your domain, but I believe he wishes to go beyond trickery. Would you help me stop him?
      * (Very Prompt) No.
    * Is it because you approve of his actions?
      * (Also Prompt) No.
* Returning the holy symbol to *B. B.* as promised, *Armadyl* then proceeds to cast Commune once again, this time reaching out for *Mharu*.
  * What's up fucker?
    * (Sarcastic) Yes.
  * Do you still watch me?
    * Intermittently.
  * Do you interfere with or influence *The Kin*'s actions?
    * Not in a long time.
* Wrapping up with those Communes, *B. B.* requests if anyone has any wine.
  * There is none, but *Alenia Eldaloth* offers *B. B.* some of the *Devil Weed* if she'll be responsible with it.
  * Surprising her, she uses it to cast Divination instead of consuming it.
    * If we continue as we are, will we encounter *Niefendil*?
    * A vision comes to her confirming as much, assuming nothing changes the current course of action of both parties.
* *Armadyl* casts Legend Lore on the *Crown of Segnis*.
  * Learns much of its history, starting as a gift to a young individual who used his magics and performances to sneak, steal, and survive.
  * The individual then continued to use his skills along with the crown to perform the same sort of work throughout the *Pantheistic War*, gaining trust of groups before betraying them in favor of *Mharu*'s armies.
  * Eventually, some time after the war ended, he was found out and sentenced to death, beheaded, and the crown fell from his head and was lost to time.
  * It was acquired and changed hands many times, usually stolen or traded for money as expensive jewelry or a collectors item, but never used, until making its way into *Amert Godwy*'s collection.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* asks *B. B.* what Divination is like for her, interested in the experience given the source of her powers.
  * *B. B.* notes that her most recent Divination points to simply continuing their travel and things will work out, and it's not worth continuing to focus energy on finding him before then.
* *Samantha Carter* attempts to attune to *Ahinar's Armament* once again, and this time is successful.
  * It transforms into a pistol, similar to the one she already has, though much better built and more ornate.
* Wrapping up all their casting, *the party* heads to sleep.

### Deals With Devil

* Waking and gathering everyone's things in the morning, *the party* sets out once again, this time with far less trouble due to the more agreeable weather.
* *Armadyl* tells *Mytejager* about his conversations with the various gods the previous night.
  * *Mytejager* is a little weirded out by *Armadyl*'s ever-expanding rapport with the gods, feeling he should stick to just the ones 'on our side'.
  * *Ergan Ilukar* defends him, saying there's been no backlash about his interactions with his warlock patron either, so it should be fine.
    * He does note, however, that the patron has been cagey about who or what it is, so even *Ergan Ilukar* doesn't know.
* Nearing the end of the day's travel, *Samantha Carter* and *Armadyl* notice some shadows on the horizon in the distance.
  * Not sure what they are, *the party* approaches carefully to investigate and find a circle of stone pillars.
  * The pillars are covered in magic runes, and emit a magic power, but *the party* can't determine exactly what they do.
  * Eventually *Sennin* steps inside the circle to start performing Identify, but immediately goes unconscious and a wall of energy stops anyone from going in after him.
  * In his unconscious state, *Sennin* has a dream-like interaction with some kind of being, *Moloch* that wanted to make a deal: strengthened vitality for a favor, should *Sennin* ever find himself in The Nine Hells.
  * *Sennin* agrees, learning the details: 
    * A pit fiend,Â *Emdescal*, maintains the magic that keeps him from returning to his home plane with his full powers, as punishment after angering *Asmodeus*.
    * Killing *Emdescal* will create a window of time where *Moloch* can return to start reclaiming his rulership.
    * If he chooses to forego his end of the bargain and never attempt the deed when presented with the opportunity, *Sennin*'s soul is to be claimed by *Moloch* after death.
  * Waking up after the interaction, the barrier drops and *Sennin* comes back to consciousness.
    * He feels heartier than ever and well rested, though he states he doesn't know what happened and feels fine, leaving *the party* unaware of the situation.

### More Casting

* Finishing up the short bit of travel remaining in the day to get away from the pillars, *the party* once again sets up Tiny Hut to rest for the evening.
* *Sennin* warns the others he is going to cast some sort of contact spell, but is unsure if it'll work.
  * Casting Contact Other Plane, *Sennin* fails to contact *Asmodeus*, and becomes an insane babbling vegetable.
  * *The party* eventually becomes mildly concerned with his state, and unsuccessfully try to snap him out of it.
  * After some healing, Detect Thoughts, and throwing a few shoes at his head, they laid him down to put him to sleep, which calmed and quieted him. 
* *B. B.* cast Commune to ask some questions of *Isdaima*:
  * Is *Niefendil* connected to *Aon's Maw*?
    * Unclear.
  * Is he using your following in a not-so-good way?
    * Yes.
  * Has he told you what his plans are?
    * No.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* uses Scrying to check in on *Artlaag* once again, finding him at a similar campsite as previous.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* then attempts to Scry on *Uklu*, though this is blocked in the same way as the attempt on *Niefendil* the night before.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* then asks *B. B.* to cast Sending to message *Balazar Lasa*:
  * "Artlaag sitting around in similar setting. Can't see the others. Love you, bye!" - *B. B.*
  * "Got it. I'll relay the message. Fuck it, I'll embrace it, love you too." - *Balazar Lasa*.
* Tapped on spells for the night, *the party* once again heads to sleep for a night's rest.

### A Rude Awakening

* In the morning, *Sennin* stirs a bit earlier than the others, having snapped out of his stupor from the night before.
* Slowly stirring the rest of *the party*, he comes to the conclusion that his spell did not work.
* After a short bit of gathering and packing before Tiny Hut deactivates, *Armadyl* and *Samantha Carter* hear a rumbling and thumping in in the distance.
  * As it gets louder and louder, seemingly closer and closer, the rumbling halts a short bit before the thumping comes to rest near the dome.
  * Much of *the party* begins casting preparatory spells for whatever is out there before a massive weapon slams down on the top of the dome, blasting away the snow cover that was blocking sight and revealing a massive giant attacking the dome with a greataxe.
