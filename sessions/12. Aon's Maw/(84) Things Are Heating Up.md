### Strange Conversations

* *The party* continued their conversation with the wolves in the morning.
  * Clarifying the distance, *the party* learns that *Niefendil* is about 25 to 30 miles to the south west.
  * *Mytejager* asks for the wolves' names, but they don't generally use them.
    * The leader is the only one to interact with other people enough to have one, which he gives as *Nanaki*.
  * *Mytejager* suggests they could act as great companions to his people.
    * *Nanaki* then notes they have interacted with them in the past, and is told to ask *Gauthak* about him.
* Leaving the wolves to their business, *B. B.* continues navigating *the party* towards *Aon's Maw*.
* *Sennin* sends *Moonbeam* southwest for the day, attempting to get any visual or information on *Niefendil*.
* A couple hours into the day, *Mytejager* receives a message on the sending stone and responds:
  * "This will be my third attempt. Are you really to make me waste energy to send directly in this cold? How long until you arrive?"
  * "Keep hiding, keep running, I'm coming for you and if all you can kill are old ladies I'm not afraid."
  * *The party* then discusses the message, and *Armadyl* manages to get by without suspicion, saying he hadn't received any messages in the past when asked.
* Deciding the message doesn't change anything, *the party* continued to travel onward.

### Band Of Orcs

* At lunch, *Alenia Eldaloth* uses Commune With Nature once again to learn some interesting things about the landscape.
  * Learned that the actual landmass under the snow and ice forms a ridge they have been traveling on.
* In the early afternoon, *Alenia Eldaloth* notices some shadows on the horizon, but can't quite make out what it is.
  * Pointing it out, other members managed to realized it was a group of bipedal creatures, and something larger and longer, traveling in the distance.
* Since they weren't in the direct path of travel, *the party* decided to simply carry on and keep an eye on them.
  * As travel continues, the group continued to get closer until *the party* heard a war horn and saw them rapidly approaching.
  * *Mytejager* blew his own horn back, which seemed to slow the group.
  * *Rivian* used Silent Image to create the common illusory pig and *Sennin* cast Skywrite to present the group with a message: "Oink. We mean no harm. Leave us be."
* Seeing the message, the group immediately begins to approach rapidly again, splitting to prepare to flank on the open tundra.
  * Battle ensues, the group now visibly a band of orc raiders.
  * Multiple spellcasters were among the group of orcs, resulting in multiple attempts to disrupt *the party*'s magic casting or affect their minds.
  * At one point, *Rivian* was surrounded and unconscious, only an attack away from death.
    * *Armadyl* made use of his crown's powers to Dimension Door with him away from the fight, and later heal him, saving his life.
* Wrapping up at the end of the battle, *Alenia Eldaloth*'s new ability was revealed to heal *Mytejager* as he apprehensively stepped into a lingering flame.

### The Maw

* Taking a short rest to recover, *the party* gathered up any loot and prepared to continue travel once again.
  * *Mytejager* collected 2 saplings.
  * *B. B.* found some incense on the bodies of the casters.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* used Druidcraft to predict the weather once again, learning it would be cloudy and lightly snowing, but not a blizzard.
* As *the party* continues on, the drastic change in environment begins to take hold around them as they get close to *the maw*.
  * Snow begins to give way to rock, the temperature begins to rise, and the constant cloud cover of the tundra rises into a vortex and gives way to clear sky as hot air rises from the massive volcano.
* Surveying the paths ahead of them, *the party* selects and option and begins working their way towards the main bulk of the mountain that rises to the central caldera.
  * The path leads them into a series of crevasses that stay just below surface level and avoids the poison smog clouds, the bottom of which commonly has freely flowing magma.
  * Eventually, a very thin walkway, reminiscent of a similar obstacle *the party* encountered in *The Caldur Peaks*, must be passed.
    * This time, with many more people able to make use of magical teleportation or improved skills, the group makes it across without any injuries regardless of minor slip-ups.
* Afterward, the crevasse begins to widen into a more open area and *Armadyl* carefully notices something shifting near the magma at the bottom.
  * Turning invisible and investigating, he finds some creatures that haven't seemed to take note of *the party* yet.
  * The creatures seem to be almost made of flame, and reminds *Armadyl* of *Tempris*.
  * Informing the rest of *the party*, they decide to try and sneak past unnoticed.
    * *Alenia Eldaloth* uses Pass Without A Trace to boost their chances.
    * *Armadyl* splits off taking the opposite side of the clearing to make a distraction if needed.
    * *Ergan Ilukar* eventually trips up on some solid stone, and the metal impact alerts the creatures.
    * *Armadyl* attempts to divert their attention by throwing a rock from his invisible form back towards the entrance, but sadly, the creatures quickly note the rest of *the party* in the clearing regardless.
* The creatures flare up to engage *the party*, and the session ends.
