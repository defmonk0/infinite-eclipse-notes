### Just Kidding About Leaving The City

* *Ergan Ilukar* suggests *the party* stop at the guard house one last time to see if there are any bounties they can keep an eye out for while on the *Leathnu Tundra*.
  * *The party* is informed that there's no specific bounties other than standing rewards for proof of clearing out creatures of a certain size and danger on the road.
  * Also learned of some of the common creatures and dangers native to the tundra.
* *The party* is convinced by *Mytejager* to make one last stop at *Vedelem Temple* to put some pressure on them about what's been going on.
  * On the way to the temple, *the party* spots *Albar Ronaro* out on his day off, but he quickly books it after their gaze met with *the party*'s.
  * Swinging around to the temple once again, *the party* meets with the same clergy member as before.
  * The priest, who's name is learned to be *Nallin Torevir*, leads *the party* into the sleeping quarters to have a quiet and private conversation.
  * *Mytejager* admonishes the temple for not being on top of the situation, describing it as the gods being at war, and that *Niefendil* had been under their noses for what was likely weeks.
  * *Nallin Torevir* explains their their information network has been crippled ever since *Prince Grund Caebrek* took over, as he has cracked down on their relations with the underbelly of the city they previously used, citing it as vigilantism.
  * *Armadyl* sent a message to *Prince Grund Caebrek* via the notebook to have him try to work with them in the future given the value they could provide.
    * A response eventually came back with a light splattering of blood on it.
    * He agrees to work on that the next time he is in *Teorainn*.
    * Concerned, *Armadyl* has *Sennin* use Sending to check in and make sure everything is alright, to which *the prince* responds: 
      * "Everything's fine. Currently handling a small problem in *Caldur*. Some people didn't like us poking around. Things got a little messy."
  * *Ergan Ilukar* supplied some significant money to jump-start the temple into action again, and *Nallin Torevir* assured him it'd be put to good use.
  * *The party* asked *Nallin Torevir* if they had any information on *Teng* and *Terkol Liongaze*, which he was able to supply.
    * They had kept an eye on *Terkol Liongaze*, suspicious of him after he showed up 20 years ago, already retired, and set up a life quite quickly.
    * *Mytejager* informs him he was correct to be suspicious, revealing *Terkol Liongaze*'s relation to the original iteration of *The Kin*.
    * Learned that *Nallin Torevir* was among the mercenaries hired to raid the warehouse used as *The Kin*'s hideout when they were shut down 40 years ago.
    * *The party* then brings up the other known surviving members, which *Nallin Torevir* shares what they have on their side as well.
      * *Nallin Torevir* says he'll have contacts look into *Rourdad Erano* in *Arahaam*.
      * *Nallin Torevir* last knew *Dornair Jebridrer* was run out of *Ranafyll* after being discovered about 10 years ago, but hadn't been seen since.
      * *The party* describes their interactions with *Fol Narkag* in *Argelen*, which prompts *Nallin Torevir* to theorize that *Fol Narkag* may be a werewolf since he fought a few on the night the warehouse was raided.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* verified *Azaki Othronus* was who he said he was in regards to his relations with the temple.
  * Before leaving, *the party* asks where they might find a fancy mirror and access to a teleportation circle within the city.
    * He notes that *Albar Ronaro* may have both of those, but isn't here.
    * He offers a mirror out of the fight pit, but it doesn't quite reach the requirements of the spell it was needed for.
  * On the way out, *Nallin Torevir* also gives *the party* a Ring Of Fire Resistance to help with their trip to *Aon's Maw*.

### Errands

* *The party* makes their way towards the location for *Albar Ronaro*'s house, given by *Nallin Torevir* after convincing him they'd just go ask about the things they need.
  * *Armadyl* and *Sennin* break in via Dimension Door, and search his house for his teleportation circle.
  * After setting off a trap, the two finally manage to find the circle hidden in a small secret room behind a bookshelf.
  * *Armadyl* leaves a note thanking him while *Sennin* copied the circle, and the two regroup with the rest of *the party* in the street.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* starts searching for somewhere to buy the fancy mirror she was looking for.
  * Not doing well, *Armadyl* points out a fancy hat shop nearby, suggesting they're likely to have mirrors to allow customers to see themselves.
  * Once inside, the two convince the owner to part with one of his fancier framed mirrors for 1100 gp.

### Finally On The Road

* Lacking any further possible distractions, *the party* decided it was once again time to leave the city and begins travelling northward.
* On the first day the severe cold makes itself apparent, but the weather remains clear and no significant delays occur.
  * That night while camping, *the party* discuss who they should target with their newfound ease of scrying.
  * *The party* remembers that they still have the dagger from *Taklinn* at *the scriptorium*, and that it will help a lot if scrying on *Artlaag*.

* On the next day, the weather takes a turn for the worse, and it begins to snow heavily.
  * Eventually, *the party* takes note of footprints in the snow, about 8 sets, slowly filling in from the blizzard.
  * Hoping that they at best may belong to *The Kin*, or at worst a band of orcs, *the party* follows them but attempts keeps their distance the same.
  * Eventually, settling in for the night and looking more closely, *the party* notices that one of the sets of tracks was taloned and comes to the realization that they've been walking in circles following their own tracks.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* cast Druidcraft to predict the weather for the next day, and learned the snowstorm would continue.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* then casts Scrying, focused on *Artlaag*.
    * See him camping near a forest on the edge of the road, eventually witnessing him use a sending stone to speak with someone, noting he was far less cold than they.
    * *Alenia Eldaloth* recognizes the trees, and *the party* comes to the conclusion that he must be on the road just after *Mastow* towards *Arahaam*.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* steps out of the hut while *Sennin* uses the his ring to use Scrying on *Uklu*.
    * *Uklu* is in bed, in an inn or tavern of some sort, laying down and preparing for sleep.
    * The window was open, so it would be a bit cold and unlikely he would still be in *Teorainn*
    * Meanwhile, *Alenia Eldaloth* casts Divination to ask about whether *the party* should continue to *Aon's Maw* or head towards *Artlaag*.
      * The response comes interpreted that they should continue on, and use their plan to contact *Balazar Lasa* to take care of *Artlaag*.
    * Returning inside, *Alenia Eldaloth* informs *the party* and so *Sennin* uses Sending to contact *Balazar Lasa* and inform him of *Artlaag*'s location.
      * *Balazar Lasa* is stuck at *the scriptorium* for an enchantment contract.
      * He would have to bail on it and still wouldn't be able to leave until morning.
      * Eventually, he does an additional sending back, saying he'll send *Meriele Iranapha* instead.
  * Finally, *Alenia Eldaloth* casts Scrying once again, this time on *Niefendil* with *Armadyl*'s assistance to weave his metamagic and increase their chances.
    * He is seen in a small igloo-like structure, sat by a fire in his natural form.
    * Looking at his gear, *Alenia Eldaloth* learns that he is wearing heavy plate armor, and has a longsword and shield next to him.
    * The armor and cape he wears have some runes on them, leading *the party* to assume they're magical in some way.
    * Occasionally over the 10 minutes the spell lasts, he fiddles with a holy symbol around his neck that *Alenia Eldaloth* realizes is similar to *B. B.*'s.
    * In the final seconds of the spell, *Niefendil* is startled by a noise and reactively transforms into a half-orc.
    * The noise just happened to be a wolf's howl in the distance, but as the spell ended, *Alenia Eldaloth* could hear the howl continue from *the party*'s camp as well.
  * *The party* discusses what to do about it, realizing they could use Locate Object on the sending stone to try and find him.
    * *Mytejager* gets their stone from *Armadyl* and puts it in the bag of holding to avoid any interference doing so, and to avoid the same strategy.
    * *B. B.* tries the spell, but there's no ping within range and so *the party* decides it's best to bed down for the evening.

# *368-4-2*

* *The party* awakens, and the dome is buried in snow that promptly buries *the party* as well.
  * *Sennin* has *Ergan Ilukar* use his fire breath to melt the snow and allow them to escape, as it would have taken forever otherwise.
* Gathering themselves and their things, *Alenia Eldaloth* cast Locate Creature on *Niefendil*'s half-orc form to begin the day, and *the party* continued northward toward *Aon's Maw* while hoping to find him along the way.
