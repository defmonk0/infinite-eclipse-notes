### The Obelisk

* Resuming the fight where it previously left off, *Uklu* remains lifeless on the ground and *Niefendil* face-to-face with *Armadyl*.
* *Armadyl* asks *Niefendil* who *Uklu* is to him, given his reaction, and *Niefendil* simply smirks and brushes him off, trying to hide it.
* Knowing it's what everyone came for, and that *Niefendil* will do so if he does not, *Armadyl* reaches out to touch the *Cognition Obelisk*, beginning its visions.
  * He awakens in an extremely hot space, his body tied down and unable to move.
  * He is being interrogated and tortured, asked about how *Eolai's Blood Worms* work given he was brought back to life with them.
  * Continued visions depict mages taking bits of flesh from his body, studying the effects of the *Worms*.
  * Much time passes, and eventually it is revealed that they have figured out the magic and no longer need him.
  * The war is over, but they can also end the man's immortality.
    * Doing so, the man finally passes on via a spell and an axe to the head.
  * The magic research floods into *Armadyl*'s mind, reflecting how to bind a god to mortal flesh, which could allow them to be killed or controlled, before he returns to his body in *Aon's Maw*.

### The Escape

* While *Armadyl* is receiving his visions, the battle continues on around him.
  * *B. B.* attempts to use Banishment on *Nordri Trueanvil*, but it fails.
  * *Sennin* uses Fireball against *Nordri Trueanvil* and the Deep Crow.
  * *Rivian* uses *Hvisla* to teleport onto the back of the Deep Crow.
* Eventually, *Niefendil* tells *Nordri Trueanvil* to stop holding back, having a commanding affect on him, and prompting *Nordri Trueanvil* to use Dispel Magic on *Sennin*'s Manifest Mind.
  * This allows *Niefendil* to float back down, grab *Uklu*, and disappear unabated by any usage of Counterspell.

### The Battle

* *Nordri Trueanvil* on the other hand, remains in the fight, having been left behind.
  * *Nordri Trueanvil* attempts Banishment on *B. B.* and *Alenia Eldaloth*, but this also fails.
  * *Samantha Carter* uses Vortex Warp to remove *Mytejager* from the Deep Crow's mandibles.
  * *Mytejager* then proceeds to attack *Nordri Trueanvil*, pushing him off the platform towards the lava.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* uses her Healing Spirit to heal herself, and *Rivian* stabs the Deep Crow one last time before using *Hvisla* to teleport to the spirit to also receive healing.
  * *Nordri Trueanvil* makes several attempts to escape the lava, but *Mytejager* is there to toss him back down, eventually leaving him beneath the surface of the lava.
* The Deep Crow is still an issue, but to make things worse, two Fire Elementals from the lava below have been attracted by the battle.
  * *Ergan Ilukar* is downed and too far from *the party*, dying from continued attacks.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* is knocked unconscious by the Fire Elementals, and *Rivian* brings her back up with a Healing Potion.
  * Regretfully, both *Alenia Eldaloth* and *Rivian* quickly go back down due to the Deep Crow's call and Fire Elementals, with *Alenia Eldaloth* approaching the brink of death.
  * *B. B.* manages to get the final blow on the Deep Crow.
  * *Armadyl*, now back to consciousness and seeing the shitstorm that had been brewing, flies over to *Alenia Eldaloth* and *Rivian* to twin spell a Healing Word and save them both.
  * *Mytejager* manages to down the last Fire Elemental while *Alenia Eldaloth* uses another Healing Spirit to bring herself and *Rivian* back to safety again.
* The battle calming, *Sennin* runs over to *Ergan Ilukar* and casts Gentle Repose to avoid any additional decomposition until they can Revivify him.
* *Armadyl* flies over the lava, attempting to verify *Nordri Trueanvil*'s status and sees a cooling section of magma under which he is fully submerged and unmoving.
