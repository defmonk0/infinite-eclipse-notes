### Regroup

* While *the party* tends to their wounds, *Sennin* begins investigating the inner room from which the Fire Elementals came.
  * Inside seemed to be some sort of sleeping space, with a dozen ruined metal bedframes and another table scattered about.
  * Near the table, *Sennin* finds a hexagonal baton of some kind, covered in magical runes.
* In the first space, *Mytejager* and *Armadyl* begin searching the room.
  * *Mytejager* is a bit distracted by the glass mass, but *Armadyl* manages to find another medallion under one of the overturned tables: this one depicting a wave.
* The rest of *the party* takes a short time to heal up and prepare to continue on.
  * *Ergan Ilukar* casts Prayer of Healing to give a small bump to several members of *the party*.
  * *B. B.* casts Cure Wounds on *Samantha Carter* to bring her further into a healthier spot.

### Legend Lore

* Thinking about the age of these ruins, *Mytejager* notes the age of the place.
  * This prompts *Armadyl* to offer to learn more about it, and so he focuses on casting Legend Lore while the other *party* members continue searching the structure.
    * Focusing on *Aon's Maw* itself, *Armadyl* begins to get visions passing back in time, much further than the last time he did this.
    * Images of the cosmos forming and energies floating about before the forming of the material plane as it's now known.
    * Groupings of these energies begin to coalesce and form reality: the material plane appears from the various pieces these energies produce: stone, water, wind, and the beginnings of life.
    * Eventually stagnating, as if depleted, these natural energies began to fuse with the planet, sinking into it.
    * One of those energies, dissipating, began to crack and crumble the earth beneath it, opening it like a mouth and twisting the landscape until molten rock began to flow: the forming of the volcano now known as *Aon's Maw*.
    * Time passes once again, the volcano undisturbed for an incomprehensibly long time until a tall dwarf-like man emerges from a freshly carved opening into the cavern, stating: "We might have something here..."
    * *Armadyl* comes to understand that *Aon*, *Dhama*, and *Trit* are not quite specific beings, but the balanced natural energies of the universe and its origins.
  * Considering these revelations, *Armadyl* also thinks back in detail to the main entering the cavern, and notes he was wearing a symbol of *Laikrodis, The Inquisitor*, and similar in height to the people he saw with *Birkoziik* during his visions at *Vedelem Temple*.
  * Moving to the main room and casting the spell once again, *Armadyl* now focuses on the structure itself having been built inside the volcano.
    * This time, his visions consist of individuals speaking of research, needing more samples, more flesh, and trying to 'end the war'.
      * The glimpses of research he sees remind him of the creation of *Eolai's Blood Worms*, using life as a transformative source of power to make magic, but instead on the scale of thousands of lives.
      * The many individuals that pass through the visions seem desperate for answers, terrified of being found, and guilt-ridden for their work.
    * More specifically, as time passes, he sees the cavern expanded, taking shape from an empty space to laboratory.
    * Finally, two men in solemn conversation state the war is over, and so their research should never be needed.
      * Regardless, it's valuable, and would be a waste of those who were sacrificed to gain understanding of it if it wasn't preserved in case it was ever needed again.
    * Eventually, many men, all wearing symbols of *Laikrodis* of some kind, seal the large ornate door in the platform room before heading back into the door on the opposite side of the lab.

### The Arcane Engine

* Meanwhile, *Sennin* begins on the door on the right side of the main room while *Alenia Eldaloth* summons *Tempris* and stands guard over *Armadyl*.
  * Traveling down the hall behind the door, *Sennin* notes a gentle glow from some sort of arcane glyph beneath the ash.
  * *Sennin* uses Manifest Mind to move past it to view beyond a turn, seeing another door at the end of the hall.
  * Attempting to jump over it to not set it off, *Sennin* learns the hard way that the magic is range based, and an explosion activates, damaging him and drawing *Mytejager*'s attention.
  * Pulling open the door, the two of them find a large, complicated, arcane machine built into the right wall of this new room.
    * Massive metal tubes run from the ceiling to a basin on the far side, currently blocked by cooled magma.
    * *Sennin* noted that the machine had several batons protruding from it, similar to the one he found.
    * Returning his extra to the machine starts it moving, unclogging the pipes via a spell reminiscent of *Balazar Lasa*'s Disintegrate, and lava begins to be pumped into the basin below.
    * *Sennin* and *Mytejager* notice, with the cooled magma turned to dust, the final medallion is pressed against the drain grate in the basin.
    * *Rivian*, having come to see what was going on, uses Mage Hand to grab the medallion without injury.

### Opening The Door

* Returning to the main room to rejoin the rest of *the party*, *Sennin*, *Mytejager*, and *Rivian* inform everyone of their findings.
* Placing the medallions in the platform, the hemisphere atop the pillar begins to glow purple.
  * *Armadyl* investigates, and determines it has some sort of necromantic energy to it.
  * *The party* decides to touch it as a group, just in case, and it promptly does damage to everyone.
  * Noticing the lines on the ground begin to light up as it absorbs their life force, *the party* continues feeding it until the large door alights and begins to slide open.
    * As it does, the lava pools in the back of the room begin to rise and the door to the caves begin to close, quickly making exiting a difficult option.
    * *Mytejager* suggest *B. B.* use her new axe to cast Dispel Magic on the entrance door, which stops it from rising beyond the half-way point, and lava begins to flow over the barrier and into the caves.
  * The large door promptly begins closing after sliding open, and rest of *the party* rushes inside.
* Looking around, the large circular chamber before *the party* is dark and consists of a deep lava lake surrounding a platform with a bridge to access it.
  * Atop the platform is a familiar shape: a *Cognition Obelisk*.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth*, worried about *Armadyl* being well before touching the *Cognition Obelisk*, casts Cure Wounds on him to top him up.
  * *Mytejager* suggests everyone touch the *Obelisk* at once similar to the pillar to open the door, but *Armadyl* explains that's likely not wise.

### Surprise

* Preparing for whatever may happen, *Mytejager* mixes and takes a cocktail of *White Flake* and a Potion of Healing.
* The bulk of *the party* fans out around the room, while *Armadyl*, *Mytejager*, and *Ergan Ilukar* head across the bridge toward the *Cognition Obelisk*.
  * As they cross, *Armadyl* hears a noise as if someone was jostled from sleep, quickly becoming apparent as a massive bird-like creature with six eyes, mandibles, and talons, perched upon a large stalagmite among the lava lake.
  * The creature, unpleased with the trespassers, quickly begins to engage *the party*.
* As the battle continues, a brief flash of light and smoke near the door grabs the attention of *the party*.
  * A second flash and smoke near the *Obelisk* reveals *Niefendil* appearing out of thin air, losing his Invisibility from casting Dimension Door.
  * *Uklu* then also drops invisibility, opening a Bag of Holding and dumping *Nordri Trueanvil* out in front of him.
* *Armadyl* attempts to use Banishment on the three of them, but *Niefendil* uses some kind of magical rod to absorb the magical energy and cancel the spell.
  * *Armadyl* then flies above the *Obelisk*, preparing to touch it if needed.
* *Mytejager* uses his Fire Rune to restrain *Uklu*, which immediately proves near-fatal as he and *Rivian* quickly knock him unconscious.
  * *Mytejager* then, using a reaction from *Ergan Ilukar*'s Sword of the Paruns, finishes him off.
  * This prompts *Niefendil* to pressure *Armadyl*, noting: 
    * "This was hardly civil given our agreement. I trust you'll share the information later."
  * *Niefendil* then attempts to reach down for *Uklu* and cast a spell, which *Sennin* attempts to Counterspell.
    * *Niefendil* was able to absorb the Counterspell similar to the previous Banishment, but *Armadyl* uses a subtle-spell to cast his own Counterspell unnoticed.
    * Unfortunately, *Niefendil* is observant and notices no one else had made a move to cast the additional spell, and inferred it must have been *Armadyl*, floating up to face him.
* Finally, the Deep Crow grapples and restrains *Mytejager* in it's jaws.
