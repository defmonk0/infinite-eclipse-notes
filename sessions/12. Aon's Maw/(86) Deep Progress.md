### Into The Caves

* Having gotten everyone safely into the cavern entrance and the entrance sealed behind them, *the party* took a moment to catch their breath.
  * *Armadyl* informed everyone of the sounds he heard in the distance outside, guessing *Niefendil* may be only a few hours behind at this point.
  * *The party* decides to set a trap, and so *Rivian* and *Mytejager* construct one out of dynamite and a bear trap.
  * *Sennin* also casts alarm to know when it goes off, even if they're too far to hear the explosion.
  * Meanwhile, *Alenia Eldaloth* took the time to cast Commune With Nature to feel out the upcoming landscape, learning there are several tunnels branching out from their current location.
    * Central tunnels seem to lead toward some sort of man-made structure, while outer ones may dead end.
* Continuing onward after their short rest, *the party* begins navigating the tunnels.
  * Several splits (left!) in the road are picked from, and *the party* slowly succumbs to exhaustion from the intense heat.
  * After around 3 hours of travel, the alarm spell is activated, and *Sennin* lets *the party* know.
  * *Mytejager* then takes out the Sending Stone to message *Niefendil*:
    * "Ya know, that dynamite was a great thing you taught me."
  * After 30 seconds or so for a response, he returns it to the Bag Of Holding.
* While continuing through the caverns, *the party* comes across some sort of lemur-like creature.
  * Providing it with a goodberry, the creature proves skittish and eventually runs off after revealing its fiery red hood-like ears.

### A Constructed Addition

* Eventually, *the party* comes to a sizeable stone door.
  * *Sennin* uses Clairvoyance to peek on the opposite side, and finds an open room: 
    * Two smaller doors flank either side, and a very large and ornate door across the way.
    * Two lava pools also lay to either side of this entrance door, and a platform is placed in the middle.
  * *B. B.*, taking action, simply pushes on the door to open it, and it does successfully, allowing *the party* entrance.
    * Now with everyone inside, a marble pillar ending in a dark hemisphere on the platform also catches *the party*'s attention, 
    * Kicking around in the ash and soot coating the ground throughout the structure, *B. B.* found a dark-metal medallion with the image of a mountain on it.
    * *Mytejager* investigates the largest door, finding the pattern on it familiar, but not making a connection.
      * *Armadyl* joins him, realizing the pattern is reminiscent of the surface of the *Cognition Obelisk* they had found, like it was decorated to look like one.
      * Continuing to look around, *Armadyl* also notes some lines hidden under the ash leading from the door to the platform.
    * *Sennin* tries Clairvoyance on this door as well, but this time the spell is blocked and unsuccessful.
  * Returning to the platform, *Armadyl* uses Prestidigitation to clean off the surface, and finds shapes engraved into it resembling three circles embossed with a mountain, a tree, and a wave.
    * Placing the medallion *B. B.* had found into the appropriate slot, it fits perfectly but nothing happens.

### Compounded Problems

* Deciding to search for the other medallions, *Armadyl* collects their current one and *the party* begins to head through the left(!) door.
  * The door is unlocked, so *Mytejager* proceeds through first, finding an additional large room.
    * Dozens of stone tables, some overturned and others broken, are scattered throughout.
    * A large mass of crystalline material is located in the far corner, and another door is placed on the northern wall.
    * Additionally, the other walls are covered in a series of holes, just large enough that some *party* members might be able to crawl prone through them.
  * *Rivian*, concerned about the mass, inspects it and determines it safe: simply melted glass.
* *Mytejager* tries to open the next door as well and finds it locked, prompting *Rivian* to pick it.
  * *Ergan Ilukar* heads in first to take point, and finds a room with a few fire elementals inside, which immediately begin to engage *the party*.
  * The elementals set several *party* members on fire, but *Armadyl* manages to dispatch one.
  * The sound of combat seemed to draw attention of other local creatures, and several large snake-like fire creatures come crawling out of the holes in the walls, entering the fray.
  * *B. B.* manages to use Banishment to remove the other two fire elementals from the field, and *the party* swaps to protecting her to keep them away while handling the Salamanders.
  * *Samantha Carter* is felled by the Salamanders, but *the party* clears them out shortly after, enabling *B. B.* to hold concentration on Banishment to stop the others from returning.
* As the danger passes, *Alenia Eldaloth* rushes over and uses Revivify to bring *Samantha Carter* back once again.
