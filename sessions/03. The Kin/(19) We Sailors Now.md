### Let's Charter A Boat

* Cast identify on the item from *Balazar Lasa*.
  * Learned it was known as '*Isdaima*'s Mirror Maze', and how it would act as a temporary prison for any being.
* Headed toward the docks, informing *Florian* of everything that happened along the way.
  * He's still a bit skeptical.
* At the docks, three ships were in port.
  * *RMS Gyrdh's Peace II*
  * *The Copper Coin*
  * *The Ashen Serpent*
* *The Ashen Serpent* was the one pointed out by *Nagre*, so *Florian*, *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell*, and *Alenia Eldaloth* began asking for passage.
  * Eventually agreed upon a price and method.
  * *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* helped load supplies.

### Sailing Is Boring

* After departure preparations were complete, everyone except *Alenia Eldaloth* boarded the ship.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth*, being smuggled, joined via a fish form after the boat departed to avoid being on any manifests.
* *Infinite Eclipse* took watches in the night during transit, but nothing of note happened.

# *367-6-10*

* *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* spent his time observing the crew from a distance to try and pick up how to run a ship.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* hung out as a cat with *Captain Lorelei Short*, who was fond of the fuzzy form.
* Calm seas and a lucky wind on the second day made for a quick trip.

# *367-7-1*

### The Briefest Visit To *Kereskell*

* The good winds led to *Kereskell* breaking the horizon on the third day.
* Arriving around 11am, *Alenia Eldaloth* used the same fish form to make her way to the docks separately from the ship, while everyone else waited a little over an hour to have the ship cargo inspected.
* Meeting back up on the docks, *Infinite Eclipse* made their way up the cliffs and into the city proper.
* A brief shopping trip occured.
  * Cold weather clothes bought by those who might need them.
  * *Armadyl* bought a book to learn Infernal.
* Took a visit to *Cyfnos Tree*
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* wanted to see it, and relax under it a bit after being stuck underground for so long.

### Into The Mountains!

* Exited the east side of the city, through the farmland outside the gates, and up the hiking path into the *The Caldur Peaks*.
* Continued trekking until sundown, and set up camp.
* Through the night, *Armadyl*, *Alenia Eldaloth*, and *Sennin* all began helping each other learn new languages.
* Some loud slamming was heard in the distance by the first watch, quite far away.
  * Was decided to pay attention to it, but ignore it to not pick a fight with something.
  * Second group didn't really hear it, so they didn't notice it was getting louder.
  * Third group took note again, but it was much closer by this point.
* Using *Beaks* to scout a bit around the mountainside a bit, *the party* found the sound was coming from an approaching [Stone Giant](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/stone-giant-variant).
* The session ended.
