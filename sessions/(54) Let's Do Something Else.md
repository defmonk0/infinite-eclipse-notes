    * Particularly, learned they're known as *Tala-Raksa Clan*.
  * After getting everything there, *Armadyl* stopped off at *Balazar Lasa*'s house to check on whether he was there.

  * He brushed it off a bit, saying he was fine.

### Head North

* On the way to the forest, the party found an abandoned cabin which they chose to use as shelter for the night.

* Speaking with the trees, *Alenia Eldaloth* learned that unusual things are attacking the forest, different from normal dangers.
* Eventually, the party stumbled across a series of Wretched Sorrowsworn.
  * *Sennin* had previously read about these things, and gave some basic information, including their origin plane of The Shadowfell.
* Eventually, the trail went cold at a place *Alenia Eldaloth* theorized the Firbolgs likely used Transport Via Plants to return home.
* Setting up camp for the night, another Tiny Hut was prepared.
  * During the watches, a lone Firbolg yelling for help in Elvish ran to the camp.
  * A friend was trapped and he was looking for assistance.
  * The party decided they were going, shut down the hut, and began following him into the forest.
