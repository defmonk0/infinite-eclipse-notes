### The Return To *Argelen*

* Party awoke, conversed with *Artlaag* while having breakfast.
  * Asked about where to get more dynamite.
  * Learned a bit more about the governments' search for *Mharu, The Apathetic* as well.
  * Learned *The Kin* have interacted with other fiends from The Abyss, and those fiends had, at some point, interacted with *Kinzaas, The Tormented*.
  * Learned *The Kin* have access to the Plane Shift spell.
* The party and *Artlaag* went their separate ways, and *Infinite Eclipse* started the day's journey back to *Argelen*.
  * Arrived around sundown.
  * *Armadyl* had a moment with a guard being a dick. It was good times.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* looked for ingredients to make Healing Potions, but was unsuccessful.
  * The party had dinner and set up in rooms for the night at *The Caring Hero*.
  * *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* took a walk to mess around with his new darkvision.
  * *Armadyl*, *Sennin*, and *Alenia Eldaloth* did some language studies.
  * *Ergan Ilukar* attempted to find a weapon shop, but was unable to find anything interesting. Later, he asked the guards about news and updates.
    * *Prince Grund Caebrek* is doing a tour to be better informed for the succession, starting with foreign relations in *Kereskell* and later around *The Principality of Marthaag*.

# *367-8-2*

* In the morning, the party began to search for dynamite for *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell*.
  * Eventually found a stoneworking area where it might be found.
  * Talked to a foreman, and learned dynamite was a controlled substance.
  * Through a series of poor rolls, the man was eventually intimidated into selling to the party if they met up in a short bit in a nearby alley.
  * The whole party decided to tag along for this one.
  * After a clusterfuck of negotiating on price and half-hearted robbery, the party eventually left after paying for some dynamite while the man was incapacitated in the alley.
* The group promptly got the fuck out of town.

### A Night In *Mastow*

* Contacted by *The Kin* a short bit outside the city walls.
  * The next job requested was an assassination of one *Adam Root*.
  * The party declined, stating they were not in a position to remain in *Argelen* at this time, and that they are not blind assassins.
* The party continued to travel for the next few days. During the trip:
  * *Infinite Eclipse* contacted *Balazar Lasa* to get an update on his status.
    * Learned he was at *Meriele Iranapha*'s tower.
    * Asked if he had anyone in *Argelen* to scope out the situation on *Adam Root*, which he did not.
    * He would contact and meet them in the coming days when he is done at the tower.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* made her first little free library alongside the road, halfway between the two towns.
    * Left behind *Instructional Writings On Elixirs of Health* and *Burning Lands - A History of Conflict in Semoor*.

# *367-8-4*

* In the early evening, the party arrived in *Mastow*.
* *Uzgash's Unforeseen Spectacle* was in town, with their carts and tents packed up on the outskirts.
* As soon as the party went to ask *Florian* a question, they all realized he had simply disappeared.
* Returning to the usual haunt of *The Cracked Mug*, it was quite busy as the circus was staying there as well.
* The party stayed in the open room upstairs for the night, with *Sennin* using Alarm to help protect *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* and *Isdaima's Mirror Maze*.

# *367-8-5*

* Some sleeping schmuck rolled into *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell*'s space, setting off the Alarm, but he wasn't a threat and everything was fine and sorted.
* In the morning, *Alenia Eldaloth* used Animal Messenger to inform her parents they were on their way.
* As the party set off on the road out of *Mastow* towards *Aethia*, *Florian* rejoined the party (denying he was gone).
* *Alenia Eldaloth* revealed to the rest of the party that she had given *Florian* the *Dagger of the Infirm*.

### A Wizard In The Woods

* The party camped in the woods for the first night.
  * The party took some watches, but it was mostly uneventful other than *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* wanting to throw his javelin at the local wildlife.

# *367-8-6*

* About an hour into travel for the day, *Balazar Lasa* used Sending to contact *Sennin*.
  * He was ready to meet up.
  * *Infinite Eclipse* gave a description of where they were, but it wasn't good.
  * *Balazar Lasa* teleported right on target though, using *Isdaima's Mirror Maze* as the focus for the location.
  * Filled in *Balazar Lasa* on the activities since they parted, filling him in on *The Kin*.
  * *Balazar Lasa* and *Sennin* realized *Artlaag* was likely a Warlock, and he might be able to look into information on him at the *Machairi Grand Scriptorium & Library* since he had done expeditions for *The Principality of Marthaag* in the past.
  * *Balazar Lasa* was on board to teleport the party to *Ranafyll* in the coming days to start the investigation into *Black Buck*.
  * *Sennin* asked about more spell help from *Balazar Lasa*, who agreed he could help him out.
* A few hours of travel later, the party reached the fog caused by the [Druid Grove](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/druid-grove) spell that encapsulates *Aethia*.
  * Speaking the password, the party continued uninhibited.
* Nearing the end of the day's travel and getting quite close to the village, an arrow pierced a tree close to *Alenia Eldaloth* as a warning shot, coming from someone hidden in the trees.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* recognized the arrow.
  * *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* was ready to throw down.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* called out to the individual, who revealed themselves along with a few others, the arrow being a playful jest between old friends.
