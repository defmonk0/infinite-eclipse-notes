### The Orbs Are Fine, Right?

* *Infinite Eclipse* is working their way through the dungeon.
* Find the portal room, and with a couple high arcana checks, learn about its previous destination and function.
  * Particularly, *Sennin* has a good idea of how to start it up.
* Find a small crystal orb in the corner, smoky white inside.
* Second orb found in a hallway off the portal room.
* Return from there, finding a larger main chamber.
  * Magic circles, which seem to be connected to those orbs in some way.
* Investigating a bit, *the party* was attacked by cranium rats through the closed gateway.
  * Quickly dispatched, with multiple mind-altering affects luckily avoided.
* Continued to explore halls.
  * Find traps. Some disabled, some less so.
* Found a third orb in a pile of trashed furniture.
  * *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* thought it best to spread out who carries the orbs, considering the mind-altering capabilities of the rats. 
  * Particularly he was also distrustful of *Florian*.
* A door here was locked, and couldn't be opened after a few picking attempts.
* A fourth orb was found in another hall, wedged into a stone wall.
* Eventually placed the orbs in the magic circles, opening the gate.

### Where The Hell Are These Ankhegs?

* One of the rooms beyond the gate seemed to be a sacrificial chamber full of human remains.
  * Hundreds of skeletons.
  * *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell*, *Samantha Carter*, and *Sennin* worked through the pile for various reasons.
    * *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* just briefly looking around found a coin.
    * *Samantha Carter* looked through more thoroughly to find a nice chunk of money.
    * *Sennin* took a bone, possibly thinking about how the portal is started back up.
* Another couldn't be picked.
* Next was a room with a plinth, seemingly used as a stage or sermon space.
  * Seating along the walls.
* Another room was a large library, cleared out some time ago.
  * A single piece of paper was found readable, briefly outlining *Kinzaas, The Tormented* and *Mharu, The Apathetic*'s alliance during the *Pantheistic War*.
* Off of the library, a short hall led to a room with dome-shaped dirt mounds.
  * Very roughed up room.
  * Stabbed one with a javelin.
  * This quickly brought 4 Ankhegs to *the party*, prepared to defend their hive.
