### A Buffet Banquet

* *Fallthra Bigoat* led *the party* into the dining hall, where a dozen or so other people are present.
  * A buffet-style meal is available for guests and workers to come and go as needed.
  * *Fallthra Bigoat* separates and takes a seat with *Prince Grund Caebrek* and *Agnew Solidsgurd* at a table.
  * All three of them are well armored and prepared for the evening.
* *Archguard Alexandel Weltzlin*
  * *Ergan Ilukar* heads towards *Archguard Alexandel Weltzlin* to begin conversing, and he beckons the rest of *the party* to join them upon noticing *Ergan Ilukar*'s approach.
  * *Archguard Alexandel Weltzlin* hands an envelope to *Sennin* containing a rendition of the Teleportation Circle he requested.
    * *Assemblyman Sharian Lusalor* of *The Siresian Assembly*, one of the other individuals in the room, made sure the approval went through immediately, and *Prince Grund Caebrek* did the same on behalf of *The Principality of Marthaag*.
  * *Archguard Alexandel Weltzlin* then also points out the other two individuals currently alongside *Assemblyman Sharian Lusalor*: *Assemblyman Casthor Nahala* and *Assemblywoman Fayelan Udara*.
  * *The party* is then discreetly informed that a few tails have been sent out to keep eyes on *Arai Yaeldrin* on his day off today, but it was concerning that no one has found him yet.
    * He plans to speak with *Arai Yaeldrin* on the following day while on duty to try and draw out any suspicious activity.
  * *Armadyl* asks *Archguard Alexandel Weltzlin* what he things of *the prince*'s recent actions within the city.
    * *Archguard Alexandel Weltzlin* thinks he's doing well; *the prince* is taking initiative and has no significant issues with his approach.
    * He does note that he believes *the prince* is currently taking influence from *Fallthra Bigoat*, being very head-on, and should take room to find his own style, but the forthrightness is endearing and encouraging to the people around him.
  * *Mytejager* expresses concern about possible issues with shapeshifters being among them.
    * *Archguard Alexandel Weltzlin* explains that one of the archways they passed through on the way here doubles as protection, similar to the magics employed outside of *Machairi* after the reveal of *Niefendil*, and that everyone will have passed through and been checked on the way in.
* *Prince Grund Caebrek*
  * *Sennin* begins copying the Teleportation Circle while *Mytejager* begins speaking with *Prince Grund Caebrek*.
  * *The prince* explains that if they will go willingly for questioning, there will be no need for a fight tonight, but it seems unlikely given previous experiences.
  * If a fight does start, he wants everyone detained and kept alive as best possible.
  * *Mytejager* challenges *the prince* to a small competition to see who defeats more foes, to which he agrees with a 100g bet on the line.
  * *Ergan Ilukar* joins the conversation to ask about a possible supply of Health Potions, which *the prince* agrees to provide: a total of 6 split among members of the group.
* *Lord Hurrow Grandaal*
  * Having delivered the plan and potions to the rest of *the party* (including a Potion of Strength given to *Armadyl*), *Mytejager* returns to *the prince* a short bit later to hear the end of a conversation between him and another *individual*.
  * The conversation has notes of *the individual* requesting *the prince* outlaw something, and how it is a desired outcome but it's difficult to just do.
  * The individual is introduced as *Lord Hurrow Grandaal*, and *the prince* gives *Mytejager* an estimate of about an hour before they should be going.
  * *Lord Hurrow Grandaal* inquired if he should be concerned about the evening's events happening in one of his establishments as the owner of a large portion of the land upon which the *Measctha District* is built, but is told not to worry.
* *Assemblyman Sharian Lusalor*, *Assemblywoman Fayelan Udara*, and *Assemblyman Casthor Nahala*
  * *Sennin* and *Alenia Eldaloth* join the members of *The Siresian Assembly* to introduce themselves and thank them for the expedited approval.
  * Introductions are made, and *Assemblyman Casthor Nahala* offers *the party* work, similar to their relationship with *the prince*, should they ever find themselves looking for some while in *Kereskell*.
  * *Assemblyman Casthor Nahala* also seems to be eyeing up *Alenia Eldaloth* more than the others, seemingly interested in a Wood Elf outside of *Aethia*, as a similarly unusual individual within this space.
* *Hofri Ghostforge*
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* asks the members of *The Assembly* if they could help gain *the party* access to *Kereskell University*, which they sadly can not directly, but could try and help make connections that could.
  * They point out another individual in the chamber, *Hofri Ghostforge*, a Lorehold Professor of Order at *the university*, could possibly be a good ally with such goals.
  * Overhearing and intrigued by the name, *Mytejager* joins the conversation and asks if the name is a family name, or a reflection of his work.
    * They confirm the name is in fact related to his work, and that he uses magic to temporarily bind ghosts to statues he creates to speak with them and learn their history.
* Finally, *Ergan Ilukar* inquires about active bounties and similar things that might be worthwhile, and learns of two current issues:
  * The constant threat of Hobgoblins in the valley, for which there's always a standing bounty.
  * Sightings and skirmishes with some sort of underwater creatures attacking ships in the *Vallsoto Reef*, which the military is putting together a plan to send a force to deal with it in the coming weeks.

### To The Main Event

* *Agnew Solidsgurd*, *Fallthra Bigoat*, and *Prince Grund Caebrek* gather up *the party* to prepare to leave.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* catches *Assemblyman Casthor Nahala* staring as they leave, making eye contact and waving on the way out.
  * States she things she may have made a new friend, which prompts *Mytejager* to catch on and poke fun at them.
* *Prince Grund Caebrek* discusses the plan one last time as they walk towards the bar.
  * Surrender will be offered, and if it comes to it, subdue and restrain everyone for questioning.
  * The goal is to not kill anyone, but *the prince* does offer to reimburse any diamonds *the party* may use to aid that goal if necessary.
* A running guard approaches, bringing news of a monster attack on an encampment north of the city.
  * They believe a fey creature attempted to warn them, but the creature is sick and unresponsive now.
  * *B. B.* offers to help, being trained in medicine and from the fey herself, and separates from *the party* to do so.
* As *the party* approaches their destination, a final round of preparatory castings are completed and *the party* splits up to surround the building.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* summonds *Tempris* and casts Barkskin.
  * *Sennin* gives himself and *Armadyl* Mage Armor, and then Invisibility on himself.
* *The party* enters the bar, led by *Mytejager*.
  * On the way in, *Armadyl* notices some bloodstains on the armor of a unplanned *Mistguard* standing outside.
  * *Mytejager* is stopped at the entrance by a woman explaining that they are closed tonight for a private event, but *Mytejager* manages to talk his way in just briefly to fill his mini keg.
  * Not seeming to be getting any further, *Mytejager* looks back to signal the group and gets big to initiate things.

### Lethal Non-Lethality

* *The prince* yells out for everyone to surrender peacefully and make things easy.
  * Immediately, everyone inside the bar can hear sounds coming from a basement below.
  * *Rivian* opens the back door and uses a spell to distract people in the back while *Sennin* uses Floating Disc to block the basement doors and prevent them from opening.
  * *Mytejager* tosses his new anchor weapon at someone to test it out and manages to instantly kill the bartender.
* Through the floorboards, a flash of light can be seen.
  * Another hidden individual, a roguish-type, appears from beneath the stage, attacking *Mytejager*.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* jumped onto the stage, and engages with a large dwarven man along with *Fallthra Bigoat*.
  * One of the individuals stabs *Alenia Eldaloth* and the blade is poisoned, proving far more dangerous than previously thought, before she has *Tempris* teleport *Prince Grund Caebrek*, *Ergan Ilukar*, and *Agnew Solidsgurd* further inside.
* *Samantha Carter*, outside, begins shooting the people on the deck to avoid anyone trying to run.
  * Using a walloping arrow to knock them down, she hits and subdues 3, but also accidentally manages to kill an individual.
  * *Armadyl*, seeing this, is worried about anyone else outside and flies up to get a birds-eye view to see if anyone was making a break for it.
  * *Ergan Ilukar* casts bane on a few people inside, helping minimize their impact and the danger they presented to the rest of *the party*.
  * *Prince Grund Caebrek* attacks the individual who poisoned *Alenia Eldaloth* and subdues him, but also manages to accidentally kill him.
  * *Rivian* continues to use his spell and the *Dagger of the Infirm* to hold down the people in the back area.
* *Sennin* casts Fireball beneath the floor, hitting everyone stuck down below in the basement, and uses Manifest Mind to have access to the main room.
  * *Mytejager* unloads his flurry of attacks, rendering another unconscious and another dead.
  * The blocked basement door explodes open in an arcane burst of splinters.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* is knocked unconscious on the stage, having a very close call.
  * *Armadyl* begins moving inside, hearing the fight and not seeing that anyone was escaping, and finds *Alenia Eldaloth*.
  * He quickly uses Healing Word to bring her back from the brink before casting Mind Sliver on some other individuals in the room.
  * At this point, an individual who was engaged with *Mytejager* does try to make a run for it, but is quickly halted by *Rivian* at the back door.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* uses Hold Person to subdue another individual, and *Prince Grund Caebrek* attacks and subdues the roguish individual.
  * *Agnew Solidsgurd* moves to the back and begins engaging guards that have come from below.
  * The battle continues while *Mytejager* slams his anchor through the floor to make an opening and yells threats down below.
* The spellcaster from the basement comes up the stairs and attempts to use Fireball on everyone on the main floor.
  * *Sennin* uses Counterspell to stop it, and the caster surrenders immediately after, knowing it was a lost cause.
* As the sounds of fighting die down and hostilities have ceased, *Armadyl* calls out to *Sennin* that they're going to need some use of Gentle Repose.
