### Ambushes Totally Work For Us, Right?

* Arriving at the walls of *Ranafyll*, *the party* saw several bodies hanging from them, all with the symbol of *The Ruby Lash* on them.
  * A manhunt was seemingly in full swing.
* *The party* stopped briefly at *the mansion* to make a few wooden stakes, just in case.
* Continuing northward, *the party* progressed towards the camping location *Halis* should be using for a hand-off that evening.
* On the walk, *the party* talked and got some stuff done.
  * *B. B.* wrote a letter to her parents.
  * *The party* learned that *Ergan Ilukar* was an orphan.
    * Lived on the streets of *Kereskell* and had been taken care of by the local guards during their downtime, commonly seeing them on their way to the bars.
    * This interaction is what eventually drove *Ergan Ilukar* to join the *Red Dawn*.
* Upon arrival, *the party* discussed how to go about the ambush.
  * Eventually, it was settled on that several people would wait inside Rope Trick in the center of camp, while others remained hidden around the edge.
  * *Moonbeam* and *Beaks* were used to keep an eye out so *the party* would know when *Halis* was approaching.

### The Death Of A Spawn

* Upon arrival, it was noted that *Halis* was accompanied by another individual.
* Once they could be heard and in position, Rope Trick was dropped and everyone exited to get the jump on *Halis* and his companion.
* Combat broke out, though the two of them were no match for *Infinite Eclipse*.
* After dispatching the two of them, *the party* hid the bodies and searched the camp.
  * Found a supply of money, some encrypted paperwork, a supply of drugs, and an amulet depicting The Bronze Citadel of Avernus.
* While discussing plans for what to do with the drugs, *Samantha Carter* noticed glowing coming from the bodies they stuffed into the tent.
  * Investigating it, *the party* found a large rune on *Halis*'s chest, which was now pulsing a bright orange, and growing brighter.
  * While trying to decide how to handle it, the sigil brightened up to a blinding white, and in an instant, several fiendish monsters were standing in the area.
