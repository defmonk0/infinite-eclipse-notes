  * *Alenia Eldaloth* made sure to have a consent talk about magic when casting it on friends, and made sure *the party* was aware of her situation in case someone does come for her.

  * *Alenia Eldaloth* went to the docks to try and find the tree growing from the frog they had dispatched the other night, but it was already cleaned up.

### Now THIS Is A Bar Fight

* The following day, *the party* made their way to *The Red Ink* to investigate further.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* used detect magic, this time inside the shop, but got nothing in response.
  * *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* inquired about magic tattoos, but learned they weren't common.
    * The owner offered to ask around for other artists or clients who might find where that could be done.
  * *B. B.* started looking at getting a tattoo and describing what she wanted.
  * The rest of *the party* discussed deciding to just let this be until at least after the *dinner*.
  * As there was an opening in the parlor's schedule, tattoos were acquired by a few *party* members.
    * *B. B.* got a waning gibbous moon around the left shoulder-blade.
    * *Alenia Eldaloth* a stylized sprig of mistletoe on the right forearm.
    * *Rivian* got the eclipse logo near his right shoulder-blade.
* *The party* then returned to *the house* and decided to take *Berric* out for a night on the town.
  * First took him shopping to get him some new clothes.
  * Afterward, *the party* returned to *The Merry Deck* and started trying to get *Berric* trashed.
  * A bit into the night, *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* incited a bar fight, blaming it on *Berric* to see what he could do.
    * The fight expanded to the entire bar, becoming a massive brawl.
    * This seemed to be a common occurrence, with a routine in place for moving people before they were injured and collecting payments for repairs at the end.
  * While walking home, *the party* started discussing a new name for *the house*.
    * Previously known as *Mystic Manor*, the group decided to rename it to *The Antumbral Aerie*.
  * Arriving back at home, everyone prepped and made their way to bed for the evening.
