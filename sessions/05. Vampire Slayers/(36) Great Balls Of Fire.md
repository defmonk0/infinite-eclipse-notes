# *367-9-7*

### A Short Prep

* While waiting around for the day, *the party* discussed what they knew of the *Ranafyll City Council*.
  * *Sennin* gave the names and titles of those on the council, though he hasn't interacted with them much to give more detail.
* Before departure, *the party* decided what they would bring and how they would hide it.
  * Several people brought small hidden weapons and *Sennin* planned to sneak in the Bag of Holding.

### The Party Begins

* Arriving at *the event*, *the party* was greeted and let in by *Allen Simler*, the guard who joined in the fight against the Froghemoth.
  * His armor was nicer, looking like he was promoted.
* Significant weaponry and bags were checked, though the party didn't bring much that wasn't well hidden.
* Upon entering the dining hall, *the party* was greeted by *Dayeren Underwood*.
  * *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* asked why they were here, and *Dayeren Underwood* explained *Tethren Ignominy* sent the invite, but from what he understood it was a method of meeting *the party* to nurture the relationship for future business and as a thank you for their selfless act.
* *Prince Grund Caebrek* and *Ki'yorl Nirinath* entered, and *the party* overheard a brief mention of a location in terrible condition, but the conversation was quickly shut down on arrival.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* approached *Tethren Ignominy* to figure out more about the means of the invite, though he mostly blew her off after explaining he was told to do so by *Agnew Solidsgurd*.
* Asking the same of *Agnew Solidsgurd*, *Alenia Eldaloth* was given a similar answer as from *Dayeren Underwood*, but that they recognized the unique party from previous reports.
  * The name could be received from there.
  * He suspiciously ignored the question of how they knew where they stayed.
* *Armadyl* began listening in on *Prince Grund Caebrek*'s discussion, but he was simply telling of his travels.
  * No succession decision yet, but the trip has been helpful.

### An Eventful Meal

* Dinner began, and *the party* took their places at the table.
* Small talk and prodding about *Prince Grund Caebrek*'s trip, *The Kin*, *Black Buck*, religion, northern expeditions, weaponry, and the results of the guards involved with the Froghemoth.
* As the dinner neared its end, three individuals on the balcony used scrolls to cast fireball at the table.
  * Only *Aureann Gwemonds*, *Alenia Eldaloth* and *Samantha Carter* noticed in time, but none of them could do anything about it short of warning people to take cover.
  * Everyone in *the party* except *Ergan Ilukar* went unconscious, and the three assailants were quickly under siege from guards.
