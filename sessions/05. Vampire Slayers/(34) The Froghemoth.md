### Mr. Go Home

* *The party* departed the mansion in *Ranafyll*, heading towards the house of the drug courier that *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* had previously interrogated.
* Arriving at the house, everyone waited for *Ergan Ilukar* to Misty Step inside to look around.
* The smell was immediately foul, and after looking around for a short bit, *Ergan Ilukar* let everyone else in.
* The rest of the group went into the kitchen, and found who they were looking for was dead.
  * Impaled to the wall, likely dead since the day or two after they had talked to him.

### Tattoos

* After that *dead end*, *the party* decided to start looking into the wrought tattoos of the *young drow man*.
* *Sennin* suggested heading towards the docks, as the sailors were most common to have them.
* *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* chatted up a sailor in an open-air bar (*The Merry Deck*), buying him a few drinks.
* Learned about *The Red Ink*, a tattoo parlor in the area known for their good work.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* used detect magic from the outside, but couldn't feel anything of note within.
* Learned the parlor was only open on *1 - Elso*, *2 - Ketto*, and *3 - Harma*, so they would have to come back later.

### Big Frog

* While walking and deciding what else to do for the evening, several *party* members overheard a confused couple looking into the water.
* Unsure of what they were seeing, they happily engaged *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* in their conversation, trying to determine what lay beneath the water.
* An eye stalk and tongue grabbed one of the individuals, pulling them into the water and killing them, quickly revealing the massive amphibious creature attached.
* Battle ensued, with several guards running off.
* *The party*, a lone elvish woman, and two guards who remained engaged with the creature, eventually emerging victorious.
* The guard took the group's name, 'The Four Horsemen', and left to handle the deserters.

### New Friend

* Returning to the bar they bought drinks for the sailor in earlier, *the party* began to talk with and interrogate *B. B.*.
* *The party* was skeptical since she was a bit cagey, but eventually invited her back to the mansion.
* Returning for the evening, we ended the session.
