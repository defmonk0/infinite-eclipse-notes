### This Is Going To Go Poorly

* *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* checked to make sure *Nagre* was alive, and she was fine.
* *Sennin* told everyone he knew this was *The Ruby Lash*, and that they were looking for him.
* The group's leader, *Damiro Campos*, informed them from the outside they're there with the blessing of the guards and are looking for a Drow man, and escaped slave, to return.
* *Sennin* cast Disguise Self to look like a High Elf, trying to throw them off the trail while *the party* promised to look for him.
* *The Ruby Lash*'s Cleric, *Nordri Trueanvil*, used Detect Magic to determine that *Sennin* was magically disguised, and informed *Damiro Campos* of this.
* *Damiro Campos* told the Tiefling, *Amnen Creed*, to shackle him and bring him with them.
* This provoked a fight from the rest of the group, and combat began.
* There were several close calls, but in the end, *The Ruby Lash* was left unconscious other than *Damiro Campos*, who died.

### Get Them Out Of The Streets

* Hearing guard whistles approaching in the distance, *the party* swiftly moved the bodies inside the bar.
* After carrying everyone inside and getting out of sight themselves, *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* posted up outside the bar as a the bouncer, since the regular one was also unconscious.
