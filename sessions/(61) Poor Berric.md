### Bullshitting With *Balazar*

* *Balazar Lasa* has been looking for leads on *Artlaag*.
  * Has heard of sightings of a Tortle in *Kereskell* and *Teorainn*.
  * Since *Kereskell* is more racially diverse and more likely to have a random Tortle around, he has been focused on *Teorainn*.
  * An Inn in *Teorainn* mentioned having a standing reservation for a Tortle, but he hasn't been back in a few days.
* He did pick up *The Skull Of Razaro* and *the party* decided *Balazar Lasa* should hold on to it for now.
* *The party* explained to *Balazar Lasa* what they know about the progression of the local politics.
* Also informed him of what had happened with the *Tala-Raksa Clan* over the last few days.
* *Balazar Lasa* was heading back to *Teorainn* later that day, and would let you know the name of the Inn once he got there.
* *Ribble Silverthread* decided he was done hiding out now, and would go back to work and his normal life.
* *The party* split from them to take care of some errands, with the plan to meet back up later so they could hitch a ride with *Balazar Lasa* to *Ranafyll*.

### *Machairi* Wrap-Up

* *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* went to *Vanchu's Anvil* to get his Sorrowsworn heads preserved.
  * Ended up deciding to get them dried and treated rather than stripped to the skull like normal, delivered to *the house* when complete.
  * Also got *Vanchu*'s thoughts on the current political climate, which was mostly that things are tense, but moving along well enough.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* fucked around as a bird for a bit, since she can do that now.
* *Armadyl* went to the palace to catch up with *Prince Grund Caebrek*.
  * Gets in pretty easily, though the meeting needs to be quick since *the prince* has another meeting scheduled for a short bit later.
    * *Armadyl* gave his condolences in respect to *Lady Arin Raga*.
    * Inquiring what was up with the heads on pikes, *the prince* explained that it was an example of dissidents to his decision forgo picking a temporary ruler, a suggestion he took from *Fallthra Bigoat*.
      * *Armadyl* explained that people are a little freaked out by it, which he agreed he had noticed as well, saying he would take them down soon and that it was a regrettable necessity that they were there for a bit.
    * *Armadyl* checked in on their search for *The Kin*, of which there wasn't much to report.
      * The cities have been notified to keep and eye out, and a request was sent to *Kereskell* for the same.
    * Before leaving, *Armadyl* used a subtle-spell Suggestion to suggest *the prince* 'be good'.
  * On the way out, he passed *Fallthra Bigoat* and *Dayeren Underwood* who were on their way in for their meeting.
    * *Armadyl* gave *Fallthra Bigoat* a bit of a hard time about the heads, which came to a surprise to *Dayeren Underwood*, before going their separate ways.
* *Sennin* went to find exotic riding gear.
  * Commissioned two exotic riding gear from a friend of *Vanchu*, planned to be picked up at a later daye.

### The Fuck Happened, *Berric*?

* Meeting back up, *the party* looked for their package they had been expecting at *The Beaver & Mouse Inn*, but it was still not there.
  * Messaging *Berric* via sending, *B. B.* double checked that he send it.
    * *The party* realized the destination wasn't quite right and the package would likely need to be picked up.
    * *Berric* asked when *the party* would be back, seeming a bit distressed, and noting they may want to return soon.
  * Going to the small *Reservoir Region Runners* office in *Machairi*, *the party* got their package pretty easily.
* Returning to *Balazar Lasa*'s house, *the party* took a brief look through the paperwork from *Agnew Solidsgurd*.
  * Mostly consisted of a list of names of dead people, with a few exceptions and their known locations when possible.
  * Gave *Balazar Lasa* the information on one individual (*Terkol Liongaze*), who was last known to be in *Teorainn*, just to check in on.
* Having finished up everything in *Machairi*, *the party* took *Balazar Lasa*'s teleportation circle to *the house* in *Ranafyll*.
* Downstairs, *Berric* almost shot *B. B.* with an arrow as he was a bit jittery.
  * Explains he had been held hostage for a couple days, though he can't remember exactly by who as he has some memory loss.
  * Can't remember the person exactly, but remembers a battle axe and can guess they were of a shorter stature based on the height of the arrows he shot toward them.
  * Also of note was that the individual's wounds from the arrows healed very quickly, and seemingly without any intervention.
  * After capturing *Berric*, the individual healed him and held him captive for a couple days before suddenly leaving, stating he didn't need to be there anymore.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* planted the couple of saplings *the party* had gathered while the others investigated the state of *the house*.
* *Sennin* warned *Balazar Lasa* of what had happened here via Sending, and *Balazar Lasa* noted he might need to go back to *Ribble Silverthread* if they're still active.

### We Should Go

* Since they were likely after *the party* in particular, it made sense that it would be safer if *the party* wasn't present.
  * *Berric* should stop answering the door unless he's expecting someone, and *the party* will check in more regularly.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* gave *Berric* 50g to repair the holes in the walls from the arrows.
* Some people restocked supplies and gathered items from the safe.
* *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* received a letter from *Miles Jerner*, a response to his proposed trade for the various monster heads he's been collecting.
* It was revealed that *Berric* had gotten a part-time job at *The Merry Deck*, acting as a server and collecting the repair donations at the end of the fights that break out there.
* *The party* decided to stop in and visit *Agnew Solidsgurd*, specifically to ask about the individual who broke in to *the house*.
  * He had no idea it had happened, and assured *the party* it wasn't a member of *Black Buck*.
  * He offered to hire some muscle to watch over *the house*, to which *the party* agreed and *Ergan Ilukar* paid 200g for, which would cover about twenty-five days for the two people.
  * It was also noted that *Agnew Solidsgurd* wasn't familiar with any members of the *Dusange Vampire Clan* who matched the description either.
  * As a last set of questions, *the party* asked about the current whereabouts of *Tethren Ignominy*, who has sold his life in *Ranafyll* and traveled south, into *The Dominion of Siresia*.
  * Finally, they also asked about *Ki'yorl Nirinath*, who is currently on a trip to *Asvarholm*, though *the party* did learn his home isn't far from *The Antumbral Aerie*.
* Departing the *Hlavar-Jufa Keep*, *the party* started discussing where they were headed next.
  * *The party* started by making one last stop at *the house* to check in on a few more things and let *Berric* know what was going on.
  * *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* had *Sennin* do some research in the study to see if anything was missing, and try and learn more about the various *Hallowed Remnants* they've been involved with.
    * Learned that *Segnis* was a bard, and he would use that to invade enemy camps and create an atmosphere of false security before attacks came.
    * Also tried seeing if *Ergan Ilukar*'s sword was mentioned at all, but only found information on a broken sword currently held in a *Kereskell* museum.
  * *Armadyl* used the Sending Stone once again, messaging *Niefendil*.
    * "Found out about your *surprise*, cute. Trust we won't need to worry about that anymore? Aside, what did you seek in Carceri? Why the worms?"
    * Response was that it shouldn't be a problem, and that they were searching for the resting place of a god. The worms were just a pleasant surprise.
  * *The party* then made their way out of the city and southward towards *Caldur* in the mid-afternoon.
