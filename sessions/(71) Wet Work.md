### Learning About The Obelisk

* *Manfred Iranapha* questioned *the party* about how they came across the obelisk, learning of it's protections.
* It quickly became apparent that the *Cognition Obelisk* was drained of energy, and so it must have been activated.
  * *Manfred Iranapha* inquired about this, and *Armadyl* told him and *the party* everything he saw in the visions imparted by *the obelisk*.
* *Manfred Iranapha* started pondering on the information, and *Mytejager* inquired what this thing was.
  * *Manfred Iranapha* then explained that it was a *Cognition Obelisk*, how they work, and that they've been the source of most *Pantheistic War*-era history that society has recovered.
  * It was also explained that it recharges passively over time, and could take upwards of a year before it's ready to activate again.
* There was a bit of back-and-forth about the resulting aftermath of having found this, and *Alenia Eldaloth* managed to convince *Manfred Iranapha* to let them leave and not be involved.
* *Mytejager* started mentioning *The Kin* and their history, to which *Manfred Iranapha* stated he didn't wanna know.
* Leaving him to contact *the university*, *the party* pushed on for a bit, traveling into the night to get some distance from *the obelisk* before settling in to camp.

### Watches & Waterbreathing

* While preparing Tiny Hut, *the party* began discussing their plans for the next day.
  * Having a description of the dagger seen in the vision, *the party* could make use of Locate Object to hunt it down.
  * Consensus is gathered to begin searching underwater in *Gloomwater Lake* to try and find it before anyone else can get ahold of it.
* *The party* then begins resting for the evening, setting up watches.
  * During the night, *the party* begins to hear construction and logging in the distance, seeming to be the beginnings of an outpost being set up near the *Cognition Obelisk*.
  * As dawn comes, *Mytejager* begins to feel the effects of his addiction to the drugs he took en-masse to contact *Birkoziik*, but decides to hide it from the others.

### Sneaking Didn't Work

* In the morning, *the party* gathers their things and begins to set out under the water of *Gloomwater Lake*, making use of *Sennin*'s Water Breathing.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* and *B. B.* take turns, strategically making use of Locate Object in proper intervals to cover as much of the lake as possible as they travel.
* At some point after several hours, *the party* hears a rhythmic clicking noise in the distance, believed to be a language *the party* couldn't understand.
  * They stop to try and figure out what is going on, and eventually *Sennin* used Comprehend Languages, understanding the sound was some individuals complaining about their job of keeping watch out here.
  * *The party* prepares accordingly, and then sneaks their way past the group unnoticed.
  * Shortly after, another, different set of creatures, notices *the party* regardless, rushing them and starting a fight.
  * The sound of combat then attracted the original group, a squad of Merrow, expanding the fight.
  * Eventually, *the party* emerges victorious, though tired, having let none of the Merrow get away in case they tried to return with backup.
* Regrouping after the battle, the party began discussing where to go next.
