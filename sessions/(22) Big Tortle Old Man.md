### Here's The Job

* *Artlaag* explained the job was to destroy or unbind a monster let loose in a cave near *Argelen*.
* Was discovered after releasing it that the monster was a [Flind](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/flind).
* Warned that it could be very dangerous, and undoing the ritual used to bind it was likely the safer option.
* Will pay 1000gp each (7k total).
* *The party* wished to discuss it and get back to him.
* Told to meet him with an answer at *The Cracked Mug* whenever they were ready.

### Discussion & Acceptance

* Returned to town.
* On the walk, discussed the job.
  * *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* listed many reasons *Infinite Eclipse* shouldn't be working with *The Kin*.
  * He also suggested *the party* go to *Ranafyll* to start to handle the problem that is *Black Buck*
  * *Sennin* though the priority should be to meet up with *Balazar Lasa* before marching into *Ranafyll*.
  * *Florian* was of the opinion to keep friends close and enemies closer.
  * *Armadyl* should probably stop the abyssal fiend from unleashing upon the continent.
* Decided to message *Balazar Lasa*.
  * *Sennin* copied the sending spell, and then used another scroll to cast it.
  * Learned he should hopefully be free soon, and will meet up wherever.
* *Party* wanted more information, so they asked *Artlaag* what the plan was if they *didn't* take the job.
  * Another group would be hired if one could be found.
  * Otherwise, they'd hope the cave-in holds it until *Artlaag* and the other higher-ups of *The Kin* could take care of it themselves.
* Decided it wasn't worth the risk of it escaping, so *the party* agreed to take the job.
  * *Florian* did some negotiating while *Alenia Eldaloth* creeped on the conversation as a cat.
    * Requested additional reinforcements, just in case, as it sounded dangerous.
    * Wanted some kind of payment up front.
    * *Artlaag* would be their reinforcements, but would take a cut (7000 divided 8 ways instead).
    * Since he would be coming, he would have no problem paying up front.
* Accepting the job and terms, *Florian* returned to the rest of *Infinite Eclipse* to spread the word.

### Errands

* *Sennin* and *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* went to *Aedwin's Abandoned House* to try and figure out where it went.
  * A brief search of the location revealed it was deconstructed carefully.
  * Later, asking *Nielas Cotte*, they learned it was torn down for the material to be reused and made into a gazebo by the river.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* went to make some purchases.
  * *Alehands Apothecary*
    * Bought *Instructional Writings On Potions of Healing*.
  * *Ods & Ends*
    * *Sybil Odhorn* wasn't asleep at the desk.
    * Asked a lot of questions and looked at some goods, but didn't want any of it.
* Upon returning and asking additional questions, *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* learned *Sybil Odhorn* had passed away while they were gone, and *Nielas Cotte* was engaged.
  * Also learned nothing of note of really found in the house when it was torn down.
    * A few music boxes, blueprints, and paperwork.
    * Archived and kept at the guardhouse.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* sent a message home using the Animal Messenger spell.
* *Ergan Ilukar* summoned his horse using his new spell as well.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* pulled *Florian* aside for a conversation.
  * Wanted explanation of the attack on *Sennin*, and to understand the motivations and whether it was something to continue to worry about.
  * In return, she'd give him the *Dagger of the Infirm* from [(01) Sowing Festival](%2801%29%20Sowing%20Festival.md).
  * Got an explanation that, more or less, it was for the money, and that money is no longer available, so it didn't really need to be worried about.
  * The dagger is now in *Florian*'s possession.

### The Long Road Ahead

* Started traveling at a fast pace in the morning towards *Argelen*.
  * Wanted to see if *Artlaag* could keep up.
* Travel was uneventful, and in the evening camp was set up.
  * *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* had a conversation with *Artlaag*.
    * Wanted information on why they keep leaving messes behind.
    * *Artlaag* sort of side-stepped the question chalking it up to a side-effect of chasing knowledge.
    * Also learned that to unbind the [Flind](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/flind) there are gems on pedestals that magic power should be focused into.
      * Overloading the crystal with enough power will cause it to stop functioning.
    * Learned that *Artlaag* had been personally bank-rolling *The Kin* out of his own funds for some time.
      * He earned his fortunes as an archaeologist on expeditions for the *Marthaagite* government some years ago.
      * This piqued *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell*'s interest, prompting him to ask about any travel into the *Oighir Sea*.
      * *Artlaag* had been there before, but revealed little that wasn't already known other than that the expeditions stopped some time ago and the captains of the icebreakers could be persuaded to make private trips.

* Another day, more travel.
* Around midday, a large caravan passed *the party*.
* Upon approaching, they were revealed to be *Uzgash's Unforeseen Spectacle*, a traveling circus or performance troupe of some kind.
  * *Florian* pulled his cloak up and gave a few words about avoiding circus-folk.
* Each group passed eachother with little interactions and no incident.
* That night, *the party* set up camp and begun talking with *Artlaag* again.
  * Learned they haven't necessarily been trying to get actual access to The Abyss, just peek inside.
  * Are attempting to find information about *Kinzaas, The Tormented*, as his passage into The Abyss is the last known trace of a god manifested on the material plane.
  * *Artlaag* has been to some other planes, namely The Feywild (on purpose) and The Astral Plane (less on purpose).
  * Had a bit of a philosophical discussion about the gods, namely their imperfections and how *Artlaag* views them.

# *367-7-9*

* Set off again in the morning.
* Uneventful travel again.
  * Roads are safe. Who knew?

### A Brief Stop In *Argelen*

* Surrounded by wooden walls, *the party* passed through a guarded gate after getting the go-ahead to enter.
* *Artlaag* led *the party* to *The Caring Hero*, a guesthouse for the evening's stay.
  * A bit expensive, but really nice.
  * *Florian* asked the staff about the caravan that they had passed, learning they had been in town for a little over a week to do shows, and are likely headed toward *Caldur* next.
* *The party* bed down in their nice rooms for a good rest before the big day tomorrow.

### To The Cavern!

* In the morning, travel plans were set and *Artlaag* did some shopping.
* Setting out, the travel was beautiful along the lake, but uneventful.
* Around 8 hours later, as the sun began to set, *the party* arrived at the cave in question.
* Decided tonight seemed like as good a time as any.
  * *Alenia Eldaloth* did some spider recon to see if she could detect what was inside, but got little information other than some steps on the left and right of the room.
  * *Sennin* case mage armor on himself, *Armadyl*, and *Florian* to buff everyone's defenses.
  * *The party* took a short rest to recover their prep spells.
  * *Artlaag* set up explosives to blow out the cave-in, *Alenia Eldaloth* summoned *Tempris*, and *Stolthet 'Mytejager' Nordligefjell* got big.
  * After the explosion, the group rushed in.
  * Inside, *the party* could see a pair of yellow eyes glowing in the dark, and several pairs of red.
