### Finding *Eline*

* Regrouping, *the party* requests that *B. B.* use Locate Creature to try and find *Eline* while everyone else tends to their wounds.
* Having a firm idea of her location, *the party* split to go after her while leaving behind anyone too injured to chance another fight.
  * Specifically: *Alenia Eldaloth*, *Sennin*, and *Ergan Ilukar* stayed behind.
* Stealthily moving ahead of the rest of the group, *Rivian* found her unnoticed.
  * Her body language and the dead body of *Tizin* led *Rivian* to summon the rest of the group up to engage with her together.
  * *Armadyl* approached to begin the conversation, wary of the metal contraption she kept readied at her hip.
  * *Mytejager* and *Armadyl* have a short back and forth on what to do before *Armadyl* resolves to approaching *Tizin*'s body.
  * *Armadyl* convinces *Eline* that they're not going to attack her at this point, and so she tosses her weapon away, which makes its way to *Samantha Carter*, who accepts it excitedly.
  * *Armadyl* then offers to bring *Tizin* back, to which *Eline* offers whatever *the party* wants in return, and so the group travels with *Eline* back to the rest of *the party* at the site of the battle.
* Meanwhile, *the party* gathered and looted the battlefield.
  * Found some money, and a Band of Loyalty.
* Upon their return, *the party* settled in for the duration of the Raise Dead spell that was cast.
* During the spell, *the party* began questioning *Eline*.
  * Learned that *The Covenant* sent them, and they did not warn her group of the level of capability *the party* possessed.
  * She offered up some notes and a map, containing logistical information for their group which included:
    * The job to kill *the party*.
    * A meeting appointment with someone to drop off stolen goods to sell and report on the job.
    * The location of *Eline's Roses*' hideout.
    * Learned *Tizin* was an apprentice, orphaned in a monster attack on his hometown that *Eline's Roses* eventually put a stop to.
    * Learned she planned to escape the eyes of *The Covenant* by heading to *Talamh*.
* At completion of the spell, *Eline* gives *Tizin* a health potion to get him back into shape before dragging him off into the woods, heading east to find passage off of *the continent*.

### Travel & Investigation

* After *Eline*'s departure, *the party* began the trek toward the hideout marked on the small map they received.
* The trip was mostly uneventful, and *the party* arrived around lunch time, finding a small, run down, overgrown hunting shelter.
* *The party* quickly found a hidden hatch to a basement, and most began to investigate and loot it.
  * *Mytejager* struggled to fit, so he left offering to go hunt for some lunch.
  * *Armadyl* stayed at ground level, having a small breakdown about where the crown might be.
    * Feeling the various fluctuations in his connection to the crown from it being placed in and out of the Bag of Holding, his concern grows.
    * Mentally retracing his steps, he eventually asks *the party* if anyone knows where it is.
    * Narrowing down when he last used it and when it was last seen, *Alenia Eldaloth* notes she knows he had it during the *campus tour* at *Kereskell University*.
    * *The party* agrees they'll attempt a locate object the next day.
  * The rest of *the party* searched for items, finding several interesting items:
    * 300 gp of diamonds
    * 200 gp of miscellaneous gems
    * A crate of wine (9 bottles)
    * Various weapons, shields, and tools
    * Potion of Healing x9
    * A large marble on a stand, identified to be one of *The Hallowed Remnants*: *Ahinar's Armament*, which *Samantha Carter* tries and fails to attune to
* Completing their business searching the hideout, *the party* came to realize *Mytejager* had been gone for quite a while.

### *Mytejager*'s High

* After getting some distance and finding a comfortable clearing in the woods, *Mytejager* created a small shrine of his trophies and placed the *Crown of Segnis* in the center.
* *Mytejager* then proceeds to activate a prophetic state offered by his Storm Rune, and downed a bunch of drugs in an attempt to reach out to *Birkoziik*.
* Entering the familiar white space in which several people have communicated with him, *Birkoziik* appears to have a conversation, quite amused by the method.
* *Birkoziik* offers the same information he gave *Armadyl* when he asked earlier: the *Crown of Segnis* is a tool and how it's used is what matters.
* *Mytejager* explains that *Armadyl* has noted that he has been distraught at not hearing from him, and that he has been hearing another voice who *Mytejager* believes to be *Mharu*.
* At the mention of their interactions, *Birkoziik* immediately grows angry, noting he will need to discuss this with '*the others*'.
* *Mytejager* then requests that *Birkoziik* fight him, to confirm his identity, which quickly calms and amuses him, and he agrees.
* The battle begins, and *Mytejager* does manage to land a few decent hits, but the battle is quickly decided when both individuals grow larger and, with a final strike, *Mytejager* reawakens to the real world, his high having passed over the course of the hour.
* A final whisper comes to *Mytejager*:
  * "Have him reach out."
* *Mytejager* then relaxes, taking time after the surreal experience to settle back in and process.

### Return of *The Crown*

* *The party* sets out to find *Mytejager*, and are successful after a short bit.
* *Mytejager* says he's had a bad day of hunting, hence the time and lack of food, which is met with mixed levels of belief, though no one pushes the issue.
* On the walk back toward the hunting shack, *Mytejager* whispers to *Armadyl* that he wanted to talk in private that night.
* *Alenia Eldaloth* fixes the broken trap door for some carpentry practice.
* *B. B.* carves her initials into the door for fun, which prompts a conversation about her real name.
  * She doesn't offer much about it, sort of dodging the question.
* Some hours of studying and relaxing after the rough day, *the party* set up camp via Tiny Hut for the night.
  * During the first watch, *B. B.* and *Alenia Eldaloth* chat, and *B. B.* eventually offers her a nickname: Barney.
  * During the third watch, *Armadyl* and *Mytejager* walk a short bit away to not disturb anyone as they talk.
    * *Armadyl* notices he is no longer attuned to the crown, having been separated for too long.
    * *Mytejager* pulls out and reveals the crown, tossing it to the ground in front of them.
    * *Mytejager* explains that he had a conversation with *Birkoziik*, how *Birkoziik* was surprised by the state of *Armadyl*, and *Mytejager*'s concerns about *the crown*.
    * He passes along the message that *Birkoziik* wants to speak with *Armadyl*.
    * The conversation goes back and forth, eventually leading to *Armadyl* expressing his guilt about the events in Carceri, and *Mytejager* retorting that interacting with *Mharu* will only make that worse.
    * Upon picking up the crown, the two eventually resolve to have *Mytejager* continue to hold on to the *Crown of Segnis* in the Bag of Holding.
    * The two eventually then return to the dome to complete their watch and the night.
